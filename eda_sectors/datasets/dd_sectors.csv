0,Electricity,https://drawdown.org/sectors/electricity,200.6–440.2,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Electricity is particles in motion—a flow of electrons from one place to another that keeps air conditioners cooling, heaters heating, lights illuminating, computers computing, and all manner of motors humming. For much of the world, electricity powers the realities of daily life, yet 840 million people still lack access to electricity.
Since the emergence of electrical systems in the late 1800s, society has created most of its electricity by using fossil fuels. The process? Burn coal, oil, or gas. Heat water to create steam. Steam turns a turbine. Turbine rotates a generator to get electrons moving. The locked-up energy of long-buried plants and animals is transmuted into electricity, as carbon dioxide spills into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Today, electricity production gives rise to 25% of heat-trapping emissions globally.
How can we generate electricity for the whole world without burning fossil fuels? How do the means of transmitting, storing, and using electricity need to evolve? 
These questions are critical for addressing emissions, especially given the current push to “electrify everything,” from cars to home heating, needing clean power on which to run. A mosaic of solutions is required, centered around electricity efficiency, production, and a more robust electrical system.
Enhance Efficiency
Electricity efficiency solutions include technologies and practices that reduce demand for electricity generation, literally lightening the load. The two biggest end-users of electricity are buildings and industry, in roughly equal measure. While a home or factory may be the location of efficiency measures, these emissions get counted at the power plant where they are created or avoided, as part of the electricity sector. (See further exploration of buildings and industry below.)
Shift Production
Production of electricity must move away from fossil fuels, as quickly as possible. A spectrum of solutions can help, from small-scale/distributed to large-scale/centralized. Some solutions harvest photons from the sun. Others tap nature’s generous kinetic energy—the movement of wind and water. Still others use an alternate source of heat, such as geothermal or nuclear, for the same basic steam-turbine process.
Improve the System
To enable the transition to renewable electricity production and use, the broader electricity system also needs to evolve and upgrade. Flexible grids for transmission and effective energy storage make it possible to better balance electricity supply with demand.

As we look forward, an electricity transformation is undeniably possible. Already, economics favor wind and sun over fossil fuels in many places. A shift away from coal-powered electricity is underway in the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, albeit not fast or widespread enough. The speed of transformation is the issue at hand. We must curtail and supplant 19th and 20th-century forms of production more rapidly—including the large pipeline of proposed new coal plants—while ensuring that the future of clean electricity is equitable and empowering for all.

1,"Food, Agriculture, and Land Use",https://drawdown.org/sectors/food-agriculture-land-use,204.2–273.9,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Human activity has transformed a significant fraction of the planet’s land, especially for growing food and harvesting forests. Land is the common ground of shelter, sustenance, feed for animals, fiber, timber, and some sources of energy, as well as the direct source of livelihood for billions of people.
Our pursuit of those ends often disrupts or displaces ecosystems, and the twin forces of a growing population and rising consumption mean the challenge of stewarding land in sustainable ways will only intensify. Today, agriculture and forestry activities generate 24% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.
How can we reduce the pressures on ecosystems and land, while meeting the growing demands for food and fiber worldwide? How can we do what we do on land better, tending it in ways that decrease emissions from agriculture and forestry? 
The answers to these questions are critical for stemming greenhouse gases, sustaining the planet’s living systems, addressing food security, and protecting human health, all inextricably linked. Solutions in this sector are focused on waste and diets, ecosystem protection, and better agriculture practices.
Address Waste and Diets
By shifting diets and addressing food waste, the global demand for food can significantly drop. Eating lower on the food chain and ensuring what’s grown gets eaten is a powerful combination that lowers farming inputs, land-clearing, and all associated emissions.
Protect Ecosystems
When land and ecosystems are deliberately protected, activities that release carbon from vegetation and soil are stopped before they start. In addition, improving food production on existing farmland may reduce the pressure on other, nearby landscapes, thereby sparing them from clearing.
Shift Agriculture Practices
Better agriculture practices can lower emissions from cropland and pastures, including methane generated by growing rice and raising ruminants, nitrous oxide emitted from manure and overusing fertilizers, and carbon dioxide released by disturbing soils.

Farming and forestry practices can also support the role of land in removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Many solutions that stop land-based emissions also enhance carbon sinks (explored below). Solutions in this sector are significant for improving food security and agricultural resilience as well, because many of them contribute to a more robust food system, better able to withstand climate impacts.
 "
2,Industry,https://drawdown.org/sectors/industry,128.8–143.8,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
From concrete to computers, cars to clothing, industry is the sector of production that makes them all. It includes strings of connected activities: extracting raw materials, manufacturing component parts and completed goods, provisioning them for use, dealing with disposal, and (possibly) putting waste back to work. The dominant mode of operation is take-make-use-trash—a linear flow of materials that is inefficient and untenable.
This sector derives its name from the Latin for “diligence.” Industry’s hard work certainly propels economic activity but it also creates substantial emissions—and some of the hardest to halt. Industry requires the use of energy-hungry machines, furnaces, and boilers, and often employs polluting processes. Many of its emissions happen on-site—at a plant or factory, for example—making industry directly responsible for 21% of all heat-trapping emissions. Given its appetite for electricity, industry also drives almost half of off-site electricity generation emissions (as explored above). Within this sector, production of cement, iron, and steel top the emissions charts. Aluminum, fertilizers, paper, plastics, processed foods, textiles, and waste pile up the problem.
How can we improve industrial processes and materials produced? How can industry make use of waste and move toward flows of substances that are efficient and circular? 
These questions have implications that reach well beyond this sector, as it’s fundamentally linked with mobility, infrastructure, buildings, food, and technologies of all sorts. Industry solutions cluster around materials, waste, refrigerants, and energy efficiency.
Improve Materials
Plastic, metals, and cement are some of the most ubiquitous materials. They’re also prime candidates for improvement and replacement with better alternatives that can meet the same needs, but with lower emissions.
Use Waste
Waste can be reclaimed as a resource—something of value, rather than something to discard—to reduce the use of raw materials and energy, thereby reducing emissions. The most advanced approaches move us toward a circular economy.
Address Refrigerants
The chemicals used in refrigeration are potent greenhouse gases, which often leak during use or disposal. We can better manage and dispose of the fluorinated gases currently used as refrigerants, and, ultimately, replace them with benign alternatives.
Enhance Efficiency
Industrial processes can also reduce emissions through energy-efficiency and using low- and no-carbon energy sources.

Industry—especially heavy industry—presents some of the biggest challenges for reducing emissions to zero. For example, the manufacturing of concrete, a staple of modern construction, releases a great deal of carbon dioxide. A number of industrial processes, such as fabricating steel, require very high temperatures that, for now, rely on burning fossil fuels. This sector is likely to see critical new solutions in the years ahead.
NOTE: To date, Project Drawdown has assessed a limited selection of industry solutions. This solution set will expand in the future (e.g., solutions for production of chemicals, steel, and textiles). 
 "
3,Transportation,https://drawdown.org/sectors/transportation,58–97.4,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Getting people or things from point A to point B, and perhaps back again: In some ways, transportation is incredibly simple. Human beings would be stuck at the speed of walk, run, swim, or horse if it weren’t for planes, trains, automobiles, buses, bicycles, and boats. Mobility has played a critical and complex role in shaping society, and the demand for it is only growing.
Most of the energy driving mobility has, to date, been generated by burning liquid hydrocarbons, namely gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Why? Because of a formidable combination of energy density (the energy contained within a liter or gallon), abundance, and low cost. But account for what isn’t included in that price, and petroleum-powered mobility is expensive indeed. Particulate matter harms human health. Oil spills ruin land and water. And then there’s the cost to the climate system: Transportation is responsible for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
How can we support the social good of mobility, but end its dependence on petroleum? In what ways do vehicles, infrastructure, and operations need to change to eliminate transportation emissions? 
These are the questions society must answer if we want to keep moving—ourselves or other items—for reasons of necessity, pleasure, or commerce. Transportation solutions address alternatives, fuel efficiency, and electrification.
Shift to Alternatives
Alternative modes of mobility reduce demand for fossil-fueled transportation or replace it altogether. With public and “pooled” transit, we can make the most of available seats. Compact cities, intentional infrastructure, and advanced communication technologies make it possible to walk, cycle, or simply stay put.
Enhance Efficiency
Where combustion engines remain in use, vehicles can be made far more fuel-efficient through mechanical improvements, lightweighting, better design, and more artful operation.
Electrify Vehicles
Electrification of vehicles completely replaces petroleum—and has even greater benefits when paired with renewable electricity generation.

These transportation solutions have the potential to save money and preempt pollution, but the transformations required are substantial and the sector can be slow to move. Vehicles remain in use for many years. New transportation infrastructure is expensive and takes time to build. Clean fuels for airplanes remain distant. But many of the solutions can, if done intelligently, create more equitable mobility and livability in our cities and communities, without forfeiting the stability of our climate.
 "
4,Buildings,https://drawdown.org/sectors/buildings,73.7–141.2,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Inside is where most people are most of the time. As central features of human life, buildings furnish space in which to dwell, gather, labor, trade, make, learn, heal, and revel. Of all the things we create, buildings are the largest, and they generally persist for decades, if not centuries. Already the world has more than 230 billion square meters of building space. Another 65 billion square meters could be added this decade.
It’s no surprise that buildings are major drivers of emissions. Some stem from the materials that comprise buildings and the process of construction, renovation, or demolition—what’s known as “embodied carbon.” Many more emissions are the result of ongoing use. Fuels are burned on site, primarily to heat space or water or for cooking. The chemicals used for cooling and refrigeration can escape as emissions. Through these direct, on-site sources buildings produce 6% of heat-trapping emissions worldwide. Buildings also use more than half of all electricity, creating an off-site, upstream impact on electricity-generation emissions (as explored above).
How can we retrofit existing buildings and create new buildings to minimize energy use? How can we stop other, on-site sources of emissions? 
These questions are at the heart of making buildings not only better for the planet, but also more affordable to operate and healthier, better places for the people inside and around them. Building solutions orient around energy efficiency, energy sources, and refrigerants. 
Enhance Efficiency
Whether for building retrofits or brand new construction, energy-efficiency solutions are largely the same. Many address the building “envelope” and insulation—means of keeping conditioned air in and unconditioned air out—while others use technology to optimize energy use.
Shift Energy Sources
Clean alternatives can replace more polluting fossil energy sources typically used to heat space, warm water, or prepare meals.
Address Refrigerants
The gases used as refrigerants today are potent greenhouse gases. We can reduce emissions by managing leaks that often happen within buildings, as well as properly disposing of refrigerants (a waste process that falls under industry, above). Ultimately, these fluorinated gases can be replaced with alternatives that are not greenhouse gases.

Many building solutions reduce on-site emissions and enhance electricity efficiency, reducing emissions at the power plant. Taken together, these solutions can transition buildings from being a major problem to potentially net-positive, as the “greenest” buildings can produce more energy than they consume. These solutions can also help ease the “energy burden” many low-income households face, as energy bills often eat up a significant and disproportionate percentage of income.
 "
5,Land Sinks,https://drawdown.org/sectors/land-sinks,243.1–387.8,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Land is a critical component of the climate system, actively engaged in the flows of carbon, nitrogen, water, and oxygen—essential building blocks for life. Carbon is the core of trees and grasses, mammals and birds, lichens and microbes. Linking one atom to the next, and to other elements, it’s the fundamental material of all living organisms. Plants and healthy ecosystems have an unparalleled capacity to absorb carbon through photosynthesis and store it in living biomass.
In addition, soils are, in large part, organic matter—once-living organisms, now decomposing—making them an enormous storehouse of carbon. Land can therefore be a powerful carbon sink, returning atmospheric carbon to living vegetation and soils. While the majority of heat-trapping emissions remain in the atmosphere, land sinks currently return 26% of human-caused emissions to Earth—literally.
How can we help sequester more carbon in biomass and soil? What can we do to support and enhance natural processes, including the capacity of land to renew? 
These questions matter not only for emissions but for a diversity of human needs—and for maintaining a healthy diversity of flora and fauna. Because soil with more carbon content can also be more productive and resilient, these questions are critical for building a thriving food system, too.
Climate solutions that enhance land-based sinks cluster around waste and diets, ecosystem protection and restoration, improved agriculture practices, and prudent use of degraded land.
Address Waste and Diets
Reducing food waste and shifting to plant-rich diets are two critical interventions to prevent deforestation. Lower demand for food and farmland spares nature from additional clearing, indirectly protecting carbon sinks.
Protect and Restore Ecosystems
“Let nature be nature” is a powerful principle—let peatlands, grasslands, and forests continue to do what they do best by protecting them from human disturbance. Where ecosystems have been degraded, restoration can help them recuperate form and function, including absorbing and storing more carbon over time.
Shift Agriculture Practices
What and how we grow, graze, or harvest can be a means to cultivate biomass and regenerate soil carbon. An array of “regenerative agriculture” methods are being rediscovered and developed worldwide, and show promising results. The integration of trees into farming through agroforestry practices is particularly powerful. All solutions that sustainably raise yields on existing farmland can also reduce the pressure to clear other areas.
Use Degraded Land
Lastly, degraded lands can be put to use in ways that revive productivity, increase biomass, and promote soil carbon sequestration—all while producing wood, fiber, or food.

There is significant overlap in the solutions that stop land-based sources of greenhouse emissions and those that support land-based carbon sinks. Their unique power is doing both at the same time. All of them are critical to coming back into balance with the planet’s living systems.
NOTE: Land sinks absorb roughly 29% of the carbon dioxide emissions pumped into the atmosphere each year. When we consider other greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, land absorbs approximately 26% of the total emissions. (Global Carbon Project analysis adjusted to include all greenhouse gases at 100-year global warming potential.) 
 "
6,Coastal and Ocean Sinks,https://drawdown.org/sectors/coastal-and-ocean-sinks,1.07–1.48,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Ours is a water world. Though Earth has a land-centric name, oceans cover 71% of its surface and make land livable. Some of the planet’s most critical processes happen where sea and air meet, as oceans absorb and redistribute heat and carbon—both rising due to the glut of emissions in the atmosphere.
Oceans have absorbed at least 90% of the excess heat generated by recent climate changes, and, since the 1980s, have taken up 20-30% of human-created carbon dioxide. The latter happens through the biological processes of photosynthesis and building calcium carbonate shells, and through simple chemistry, as carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater. Coastal and ocean sinks bring 17% of all heat-trapping emissions back to Earth.
While this uptake of heat and carbon has buffered the planet from more severe climate change, oceans are paying a steep price. How so? Water temperatures, marine heat waves, and sea levels are rising. More carbon dioxide in seawater makes the ocean more acidic and less hospitable for shellfish to build shells or coral to build their skeletons. Oxygen levels in ocean water have already declined somewhat. In the future, biomass production through photosynthesis may also drop, destabilizing the base of the food chain. What’s more, with fewer organisms alive, fewer would die and sink into the deep ocean, carrying their carbon with them.
What practices can be used to sequester carbon in coastal, marine, and open ocean environments? How can human activity support and enhance natural processes? 
These questions are vital for addressing emissions but also for shoring up oceans’ life-sustaining role. Even as oceans suffer, they also are home to significant solutions. Solutions for coastal and ocean sinks center on ecosystem protection and restoration and improved agriculture practices.
Protect and Restore Ecosystems
Protecting ecosystems—including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows—supports ongoing photosynthesis and carbon storage. Because these “blue carbon” ecosystems have been lost or degraded in many places, restoration also has a vital role to play.
Shift Agriculture Practices
Along coasts and in the open ocean, select regenerative practices may augment natural carbon sequestration from seaweed and kelp, while growing fiber and food from the sea.

Oceans will continue to be on the frontlines of climate change, as will people who live near them. Solutions focused on coastal and marine sinks can provide additional benefits from storm protection to healthy fisheries. It’s impossible to separate blue and green, land and sea. They, and we, are fundamentally intertwined.
NOTE: Project Drawdown has assessed a very limited selection of coastal and ocean solutions to date. This solution set will expand in the future (e.g., solutions for regenerative ocean farming and marine ecosystem restoration). 
 "
7,Engineered Sinks,https://drawdown.org/sectors/engineered-sinks,2.22–4.39,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Can human engineering play a supporting role to nature? That’s a question that grows in relevance and urgency, given the gap between where global emissions stand and where they need to be, posthaste. The sheer quantity of excess greenhouse gases means natural processes can’t do it all when it comes to carbon sequestration. Select nascent technologies show some promise to supplement terrestrial, coastal, and ocean sinks.
Remove carbon. Do something with it. Those are the central premises of engineered sinks. Remove can mean pulling carbon from the concentrated exhaust of a power plant or industrial process, which falls under the umbrella of “carbon capture.” Remove can also mean pulling carbon out of the air, where it’s much less concentrated.
Where carbon goes next is the other critical piece of the equation. It can be stored or buried—pairing “capture” and “storage.” Carbon can also be used—cycled quickly, perhaps for adding bubbles to a beverage or to make more sustainable jet fuels. Or it can be locked up for a long while, perhaps in concrete or through the ancient practice of baking biomass into biochar, then buried. This so-called “semi-permanent sequestration” is most powerful.
Could recaptured carbon become a commodity? Something of value? Perhaps. For now, solutions in this sector are primarily “coming attractions,” and issues of cost, scale, and the energy required all remain in the balance.
NOTE: Project Drawdown has assessed a very limited set of solutions for engineered sinks to date. This solution set will expand in the future (e.g., direct air capture). 
 "
8,Health and Education,https://drawdown.org/sectors/health-and-education,85.42,Gigatons,CO2 EquivalentReduced / Sequestered(2020–2050),"
Climate and social systems are profoundly connected, and those connections open up solutions that are often overlooked. Some initiatives, designed primarily to ensure rights and foster equality, also have cascading benefits to climate change. They include access to high-quality, voluntary reproductive healthcare and to high-quality, inclusive education, which are fundamental human rights and cornerstones of gender equality.
How many people might call this planet home in 2050 or 2100? That will depend, in large part, on fertility rates and the headway we make on securing gender equality and advancing human well-being. When levels of education rise (in particular for girls and young women), access to reproductive healthcare improves, and women’s political, social, and economic empowerment expand, fertility typically falls. Across the world and over time, this impacts population.
Currently, we humans number 7.7 billion, and the United Nations estimates the human family will grow to between 9.4 billion and 10.1 billion in 2050. As we consider the future of climate solutions, it matters how many people will be eating, moving, plugging in, building, buying, using, wasting, and all the rest. Population interacts with the primary drivers of emissions: production and consumption, largely fossil-fueled.
It’s critical to note the vast disparities in emissions from high-income countries compared to low, and between the wealthiest individuals and those of lesser financial means. For example, almost half of consumption-related emissions are generated by just 10% of people globally. The topic of population also raises the troubling, often racist, classist, and coercive history of population control. People’s choices about how many children to have should be theirs and theirs alone. And those children should inherit a livable planet. It is critical that human rights are always centered, that gender equality is the aim, and that benefits to the planet are understood as positive ripple effects of access and agency.
In its most recent report on “world population prospects,” the United Nations notes that the international community has committed to ensuring that all people have access to family planning, should they wish to use it, and the ability to decide how many children to have and when. That can mean changes in everything from contraception to culture. Living up to those commitments will be a major determinant for which possible trajectory becomes our path forward.
