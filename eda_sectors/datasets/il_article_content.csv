0,"Heat stress harms human health, agriculture, and the economy and environment more broadly, and exposure to heat stress is increasing with rising global temperatures. While most studies assessing future heat stress have focused on surface air temperature, compound extremes of heat and humidity are key drivers of heat stress. Here, we use atmospheric reanalysis data and a large initial-condition ensemble simulations of a global climate model to evaluate future changes in daily compound heat-humidity extremes as a function of increasing global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT). The changing frequency of heat-humidity extremes, measured using wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), is strongly related to GSAT and, conditional upon GSAT, nearly independent of forcing pathway. The historical ~1°C of GSAT increase above preindustrial levels has already increased the population annually exposed to at least one day with WBGT exceeding 33°C (the reference safety value for humans at rest per the ISO-7243 standard) from 97 million to 275 million. Maintaining the current population distribution, this exposure is projected to increase to 508 million with 1.5°C of warming, 789 million with 2.0°C of warming, and 1.22 billion with 3.0°C of warming (similar to late-century warming projected based on current mitigation policies).",Journal Article,['https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7d04'],"

1,"Mechanisms such as ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliﬀ collapse may rapidly increase dis-charge from marine-based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their inﬂuence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and relative sea-level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median pro-jected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant accelera-tion of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93–243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26–98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL esti-mates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.",Journal Article,['http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000663/abstract;jsessionid=B56A08DA36D079F275518C0156E20AFE.f04t03'],"

4,"The impacts of heat waves in a warming climate depend not only on changing temperatures but also on changing humidity. Using 35 simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LENS), we investigate the long‐term evolution of the joint distribution of summer relative humidity (RH) and daily maximum temperature (Tmax) near four U.S. cities (New York City, Chicago, Phoenix, and New Orleans) under the high‐emissions Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. We estimate the conditional quantiles of RH given Tmax with quantile regression models, using functions of temperature for each city in July for three time periods (1990–2005, 2026–2035, and 2071–2080). Quality‐of‐fit diagnostics indicate that these models accurately estimate conditional quantiles for each city. As expected, each quantile of Tmax increases from 1990–2005 to 2071–2080, while mean RH decreases modestly. Conditional upon a fixed quantile of Tmax, the median and high quantiles of RH decrease, while those of the Heat Index (HI) and dew point both increase. This result suggests that, despite a modest decrease in median relative humidity, heat stress measured by metrics considering both humidity and temperature in a warming climate will increase faster than that measured by temperatures alone would indicate. For a fixed Tmax, the high quantiles of RH (and thus of HI and dew point) increase from 1990–2005 to 2071–2080 in all four cities. This result suggests that the heat stress of a day at a given Tmax will increase in a warming climate due to the increase of RH.",Journal Article,"['https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032100', 'https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032100']","

5,This paper outlines a two-step process to return the United States government’s Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to the frontier of economics and climate science. The first step is to implement the original 2009-2010 Interagency Working Group (IWG) framework using a discount rate of 2%. This can be done immediately and will result in an SCC for 2020 of $125. The second step is to reconvene a new IWG tasked with comprehensively updating the SCC over the course of several months that would involve the integration of multiple recent advances in economics and science. We detail these advances here and provide recommendations on their integration into a new SCC estimation framework.,Working Paper,"['https://ssrn.com/abstract=3764255', 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3764255']","

","


The social cost of carbon (SCC), the total cost to society from the release of a ton of CO2 emissions, is vital in evaluating the benefits and costs of climate policies. To bring the SCC to the frontier of knowledge, Tamma Carleton and Michael Greenstone of the Climate Impact Lab recommend that the Biden administration immediately update it by using a discount rate of no higher than 2 percent and including global damages. These changes would produce a social cost of carbon of $125 per metric ton. As a second step, they recommend that the Biden administration form an interagency working group with the goal of returning the SCC to the frontier of understanding about the science and economics of climate change.
The Challenge and the Policy
The social cost of carbon (SCC), the monetized damages of an additional metric ton of CO2, is a key tool in evaluating which climate policies will lead to benefits that exceed costs. In the United States, the first consistent government-wide SCC came in 2010 after the Obama administration formed an Inter-agency Working Group (IWG) to provide a scientifically robust evaluation. The figure was updated to reflect the best available science in 2013 to be $52 per ton of CO2 in 2020.
Since its release, the U.S. SCC has played a central role in climate policy both inside the United States and internationally. As of 2017, the federal government had used the SCC to assess the value of more than 80 regulations with a combined $1 trillion in estimated gross benefits. Further, several countries, including Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France, Norway and Germany, have taken inspiration from the United States to implement their own SCC estimates, with some wholesale adopting the IWG framework.
Rapid scientific and economic advances mean that there is now an urgent need to update the SCC. In fact, in 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(NAS) released a report on how to bring the SCC closer to the scientific frontier. Unfortunately, the Trump administration disbanded the IWG and reduced the SCC to between $1 and $7, making changes in assumptions that were difficult to justify based on science and economics. In the past four years, the controversial and substantially lower SCC estimates used by the Trump administration have paved the way for the rollback of key environmental regulations, such as fuel economy standards.
Recommendations
To return the SCC to the frontier of knowledge, a two-step approach could be considered:
IMMEDIATE CHANGES
First, simply and immediately, the Biden administration can carry out the approach used to develop the initial estimate under the Obama administration (which included global damages, unlike the Trump SCC), but with a discount rate of no higher than 2 percent to reflects profound changes in international capital markets that make the current discount rate difficult to justify. This would result in a substantially higher social cost of $125 per ton of carbon.

Based on recent asset market trends, the discount rate, measuring the present value of future damages to society, should be set at no higher than 2 percent. In order to compare future costs and benefits to costs and benefits of actions taken today, a discount rate is used to reduce future values. Profound changes in global capital markets in recent years point to using a discount rate of 2 percent or lower.
Global damages should be incorporated. Although focusing exclusively on the domestic costs of climate change may appear to put U.S. interests first, the opposite has been shown to be true. For example, the United States leveraged 6-7 tons of CO2 reduction commitments from other countries for every ton that it pledged to cut in the Paris Climate Agreement. Ultimately, the United States’ leadership in global diplomacy is necessary to protect its citizens from climate damages caused by emissions in all countries. To use a domestic SCC would be to abandon this role and risk losing out on the benefits from foreign emissions reductions.

COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE
As a second step, the Biden administration can launch a reconstituted Inter-agency Working Group and task it with comprehensively updating the SCC. Doing so would require several essential updates (in addition to those above), and several other useful changes, as outlined here.
Essential Updates

Use an updated climate model to more accurately reflect the effect of emissions on the climate system. Existing climate models behind the SCC substantially underestimate the speed of temperature increase. A simple Earth system model that can conduct uncertainty analysis while also matching predictions from more complex, state-of-the-art models is necessary. This model can be paired with semi- e empirical models of sea level rise.
The measurement of damages from changes in the physical climate (e.g., temperature and sea level rise) should be updated to meet three important criteria. Damage functions in the current SCC are derived from ad-hoc assumptions and simplified relationships. But large-scale empirical evidence has since deepened our understanding of the economic impacts of climate change. An updated damage function should: 1) be derived from empirical estimates that reflect plausibly causal impacts of weather events on socioeconomic outcomes; 2) capture local-level nonlinearities for the entire global population (not just high-income, temperate regions); and 3) account for future adaptation.

Other Updates

Rely on a set of socioeconomic projections that can be linked to the widely-used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emissions scenarios or on new probabilistic projections that combine statistical methods with expert elicitation. Any SCC calculation relies on a set of predictions regarding how the global economy, population, and CO2 emissions will evolve in the future. Unfortunately, there has been only modest scientific progress in developing these scenarios due to the stubborn difficulties in making long-run population and economic growth projections. We recommend either combining standard socioeconomic projections (e.g., SSPs) with the RCP emissions scenarios, or using new probabilistic estimates relying on statistical and expert elicitation approaches.
The SCC should account for the considerable uncertainty about climate change damages. There are several sources of uncertainty in the calculation of the SCC (i.e. future socioeconomics, the sensitivity of the climate to emissions, economic damages from climate change), and evidence reveals that people dislike risk and are willing to pay to reduce uncertainty. Previous SCC estimates, however, chose not to account for uncertainty in valuing climate damages. Due to recent advances in computing, it is now possible to characterize these uncertainties and to incorporate their value into the calculation of the SCC.
While a strong case for equity weighting exists, incorporating it should not be done until wider guidance is issued across the government. A marginal dollar is worth more to a poor person than a wealthy one. Applying this principle to the SCC would require “equity-weighting” such that a given amount of climate damages projected to occur in poorer areas contribute more to the SCC than equal damages that occur in wealthier regions. However, conducting equity weighting would represent a significant departure from standard United States cost-benefit analysis—having significant precedential implications beyond climate regulations and environmental policy.

6,"Climate change will impact many economic sectors and aspects of natural and human wellbeing. Quantifying these impacts as they vary across regions, sectors, time, and social and climatological scenarios supports detailed planning, policy, and risk management. This article summarises and compares recent climate impact assessments in Europe (the JRC PESETA III project) and the USA (the American Climate Prospectus project). Both implement a multi-sector perspective combining high resolution climate data with sectoral impact and economic models. The assessments differ in their coverage of sectors and scenarios, mix of empirical and process-based methods, handling of uncertainty, and representation of damages. Despite the dissimilarities, projected relative economic impacts are comparable, with human mortality as the dominant impact category. Both studies further show a large spatial heterogeneity of impacts that may amplify pre-existing economic inequality in the EU and US, and that mitigation can considerably reduce economic impacts.

10,"Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies, but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature , while poor countries respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human–natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is nonlinear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.",Journal Article,[],"

13,"This paper develops the first globally comprehensive and empirically grounded estimates of mortality risk due to future temperature increases caused by climate change. Using 40 countries’ subnational data, we estimate age-specific mortality-temperature relationships that enable both extrapolation to countries without data and projection into future years while accounting for adaptation. We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extreme cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly, that is flattened by both higher incomes and adaptation to local climate (e.g., robust heating systems in cold climates and cooling systems in hot climates). Further, we develop a revealed preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs. We combine these components with 33 high-resolution climate simulations that together capture scientific uncertainty about the degree of future temperature change. Under a high emissions scenario, we estimate the mean increase in mortality risk is valued at roughly 3.2% of global GDP in 2100, with today’s cold locations benefiting and damages being especially large in today’s poor and/or hot locations. Finally, we estimate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mean [interquartile range] damages of $36.6 [-$7.8, $73.0] under a high emissions scenario and $17.1 [-$24.7, $53.6] under a moderate scenario, using a 2% discount rate that is justified by US Treasury rates over the last two decades.

Research Summary
Communities are already experiencing a changing climate as temperature extremes become a familiar trend around the globe. How much is temperature to blame when hospital visits increase during heat waves and cold spells? What role do adaptations like indoor heating and cooling systems play in blunting these effects? And, at what cost? Empirical evidence of the risks extreme temperatures pose to human health is limited since fatalities often come from periods of heat or cold that worsen underlying conditions. Individual deaths are rarely attributed to temperature surges, so public health officials and policymakers often invest less in addressing and responding to climate change. The answers to these questions would inform policymakers, city planners, business leaders, and a range of stakeholders who are preparing to mitigate and adapt as the climate becomes more unstable.
Key Takeaways

Using the largest data set ever compiled on subnational human mortality around the world, this study quantifies the relationship between temperature and death rates across the globe and identifies the role of income and protective adaptations, like indoor heating and cooling systems, in safeguarding public health.
The authors use these data-driven results to project the future impact of climate change on mortality rates and the costs and benefits of adaptation measures that populations are likely to undertake. The study reveals the net effects of hot and cold temperatures on global health and the economy, dividing the world into 24,378 distinct regions and calculating impacts for each.
Hot days with average temperatures above 35°C/95°F prove historically worse for global public health than cold days below -4°C/25°F.  On average, a single hot day increases mortality rates by 4 deaths per 1 million people, while cold days increase the mortality rate by 3 deaths per 1 million people. But substantial differences exist between places, depending on how wealthy the population is and how warm the climate is.
As temperatures rise, the damages to society grow with death rates increasing most among today’s poorest populations. By 2099 under a scenario of continued high emissions growth (SSP3-RCP8.5), climate change increases death rates in low-income countries by 106.7 deaths per 100,000. Meanwhile, high-income countries are projected to see death rates decrease by 25.2 deaths per 100,000, while spending significantly to prevent more deaths. Overall, today’s rich countries pay nearly three times more than poor countries to adapt to rising temperatures and prevent additional deaths.
Previous experience living in hotter temperatures also leads to better outcomes. For example, Houston’s population fares better than that of Seattle, Washington, on a hot day because these two wealthy U.S. cities have differing levels of experience with extreme heat. Houston each year experiences at least eight days with a daily average temperature above 85°F, while Seattle experiences less than one of these days each year on average.
Both income growth and protective investments to adapt to long-term climate change improve outcomes. In a future with continued high emissions growth, climate change’s impact on temperatures will cause an additional 73 deaths per 100,000 in 2100. This projection accounts for adaptations to climate that populations are likely to make, given historical patterns of adaptation. The benefits of adapting—reducing the death rate 29% from an average of 104 per 100,000—outweigh the costs, which would be equivalent to an additional 11 deaths per 100,000 people.
The benefits of greenhouse gas reductions are large. Even mitigation efforts that fall short of the long-term targets of the Paris Agreement would cut the projected mortality costs of warming. Under moderate emissions (SSP3-RCP4.5), those costs fall by about 84 percent at the end of the 21st century, relative to a scenario of continued high emissions.
The new analysis calculates that the mortality cost to society of each additional ton of CO2 is $36.6 per ton (using a 2 percent annual discount rate and a valuation that takes into account the age of those affected) under a scenario of continued high emissions and $17.1 per ton under a moderate emissions scenario. In other words, it would be worth it for society to pay roughly $36.6 per ton of CO2 to avoid the mortality impact from climate change.

Introduction
The world is already seeing signs that the climate is changing, with record-breaking heat being just one illustration. Summer 2019 was the hottest on record in the Northern Hemisphere, with countries across Europe experiencing their hottest days in history. The Southern Hemisphere also experienced record warmth, including in Africa where they broke their record for the warmest summer; South America where their summer ranked the third warmest; and India and Pakistan where they experienced their second-longest heat wave reaching 50.8 °C / 123.4 °F. June 2020 continued a record-breaking streak as one of the hottest months in history, as human-caused warming continues to push the Earth’s climate out of familiar territory.
Extreme heat impacts societies in many ways. One consequence that affects both the economy and human well-being is the toll heat takes on health, causing heat strokes and exacerbating existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Heat places the body under great stress, straining the circulatory systems, and is particularly dangerous to very young children and those over 65. Reports of people dying from the heat can dominate headlines, with France reporting that 1,500 people died from the hot temperatures in Summer 2019. However, in general, research indicates that heat-related mortality is substantially underreported in the media, as it takes time for the full picture of excess mortality to emerge.
What exactly is the relationship between temperatures—both hot and cold—and mortality? How do we attribute deaths from a diverse set of causes to heat? How, and how much, do people adapt to extreme hot and cold temperatures, and what does it cost them to do so? What implications do these relationships have as the world heats up over the coming century? Knowing the answers to these questions at a local and global scale would be of tremendous practical value to policymakers, city planners, business leaders, and a range of stakeholders looking to mitigate these effects. Temperature’s toll on public health, particularly extreme heat, is likely to be one of the dominant costs of climate change, and because emissions today stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, knowing the damages will be essential to taking the action we need to prepare for future risks.
Researchers have struggled to provide a credible understanding of the damages inflicted by climate change at a local and global scale. Available data was limited to wealthy parts of the globe, resulting in insufficiently complete analysis that lacked the scale and scope to credibly describe a global response to warming. Further, there has not been a clear method to quantify the costs and benefits of adaptation. Because of these difficulties, theoretical models have been widely used to capture the global nature of the problem and inform understanding of the global costs of climate change. However, the many untested assumptions implicit in these models weaken the authority of these answers. Thus, to date, there have been no globally comprehensive, spatially resolved, data-driven studies of climate impacts that account for adaptation.
Research Design
In this study, the authors produce the first global, high-resolution, data-based estimate of the full costs of climate change on mortality, accounting for adaptation. Their methodology underlies all of the work of the Climate Impact Lab:

Gather Detailed Global Economic and Climate Data: The first step is an unprecedented effort to aggregate highly localized historical data across key economic and climate indicators.
Measure Climate-Driven Costs to Society: Millions of historical observations are then analyzed to understand and quantify the relationship between climate change and mortality.
Inform Decision-Making at the Macro and Micro Levels: The socioeconomic relationships estimated from our current data are used to produce risk-based estimates of future changes at the local level, around the entire world.

Specifically, this study uses comprehensive historical mortality records to quantify how death rates across the globe have been affected by observed climate changes. The authors compile the largest sub-national vital statistics database in the world, detailing 399 million deaths across 41 countries accounting for 55 percent of the global population.
By combining these records with decades of detailed daily and local temperature observations, the authors discover that extreme cold and extreme heat have important effects on death rates. These relationships are modified by the climate and income levels of the affected population. They use these results to model how adaptation affects the sensitivity of a population to extreme temperatures.
The authors then use these estimates of the mortality-temperature relationship to generate projections of the future impacts of climate change on mortality rates for areas across the globe, dividing the world into 24,378 distinct regions (each containing roughly 300,000 people, about the size of a U.S. county). With a new technique to measure the total cost of adaptive behaviors and technologies, these projections capture the full mortality risk of climate change, for the first time accounting for both adaptation benefits and costs, in addition to direct mortality impacts.
These estimates include three projections for future income and population growth, two trajectories of future greenhouse gas emissions, and simulations from 33 climate models, allowing for an assessment of the uncertainty surrounding any particular projection. The full estimates also reflect statistical uncertainty related to the underlying economic and health data.
Projected impacts of climate change on mortality rates are then monetized and used to determine the costs of excess mortality risk in a given year. This allows the authors to compute the total monetary burden of the mortality risk imposed by the emission of a single ton of carbon dioxide (CO2).
This value represents the first empirically derived estimate of the global cost of climate change for a single sector of the economy. The authors are applying the method to other sectors of the economy (e.g. agriculture, energy systems), which will enable the calculation of the full social cost of carbon, including damage across many sectors of the global economy.
Findings
1. Each additional hot day increases the average annual global mortality rate by 4 deaths per 1 million people, while each additional cold day increases it 3 deaths per 1 million people. 
The authors find both cold days and hot days result in elevated mortality risk. An additional day with a mean (average of the daily high and low) temperature above 35°C/95°F, relative to a day at 20°C/68°F, increases the annual all-age mortality rate by 4 deaths per 1 million people on average. An additional -5°C/25°F day increases this rate by 3 deaths per 1 million people. Relative to World Bank estimates, a hot day increases the global death rate by 0.05% while a cold day increases the death rate by 0.04%.

Figure 1: The impact of extreme temperatures on death rates depends on income and average climate. This figure shows the impact of a single day at each temperature on the annual mortality rate for people aged 65 and older. Higher incomes and warmer average climates lead to lower sensitivity to extremes, particularly for hot days. The shaded areas indicate 95 percent confidence intervals.
2. Those who are poorer, older, or have less experience in dealing with extreme temperatures are impacted more by hot and cold temperatures.
The risks of extreme temperatures are not felt equally around the globe. They vary by location depending on how wealthy or how warm a place’s climate is. For example, Houston, Texas, is better adapted to hot days than temperate Seattle, Washington, though both are relatively wealthy U.S. cities. On average, we estimate that days above 30°C/86°F increase the annual elderly mortality rate by 1.8 more deaths per 100,000 population in Seattle than they do in hotter Houston, relative to a day at 20°C/68°F. Globally, we find elderly people in the coldest third of locations fare worse when daily average temperatures surpass 35°C/95°F compared to elderly people in the hottest third of locations, experiencing an additional 7.9 deaths per 100,000.
Similarly, higher incomes help enable adaptation. For example, the poorer city of Delhi, India—with a climate similar to Houston—has been less able to adapt, resulting in 0.8 deaths per 100,000. In Accra, Ghana, the impact of a hot day is even worse: an additional 1.1 deaths per 100,000. Globally, we find elderly populations in the richest third of locations are less vulnerable than those in the poorest third of locations, with a day above 35°C/95°F causing 5 fewer deaths per 100,000 in the wealthier parts of the world.
Age and income are especially significant predictors of mortality impacts. If the research team only focused on the high-income countries, where mortality data is easily accessible (as done in previous studies), they would have underestimated the effect of heat on the vulnerable elderly population by 50 percent. Globally, the effect of an additional day above 35°C/95°F among people over age 64 is 4.7 deaths per 100,000. This highlights the importance of the comprehensive, evidence-based approach used by the Climate Impact Lab to capture climate change’s impacts worldwide.
However, these mortality risks are dramatically lower if efforts to lower carbon emissions are successful. Under a moderate emissions scenario that leads to an expected 2.4°C degrees of warming by the end of the century, the total mortality impact of climate change falls by 84 percent, relative to a scenario of continued high emissions that results in 4.5°C of predicted warming (Figure 2).

Figure 2: The mortality risk of climate change across the globe. The maps indicate the full mortality risk of climate change, including both increased mortality risk and changes in expenditures on adaptation measured in units of death-equivalents. Values are shown for the year 2100 under the moderate emissions scenario (SSP3-RCP4.5) and the high emissions scenario (SSP3-RCP8.5). Colors indicate the mean prediction for each region, averaging across 1,000 simulations.
3. Climate change’s impact on temperatures is projected to increase global death rates by 73 per 100,000 in 2100 under a scenario of continued high emissions, on par with today’s leading causes of death. Adaptation efforts can save lives, but the cost is significant.
The researchers find that climate change’s global impact on death rates in 2100 is on par with the current death rate for all infectious diseases—including tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitos, and parasites—combined: approximately 74 deaths per 100,000 globally (Figure 3). These projections account for the beneficial effects of adaptation to climate change, but not their costs. Using a commonly accepted statistical metric for valuing death risk, the authors convert these adaptation costs, representing about 13 percent of the total impact, to equivalent changes in the death rate.[1] They estimate the full mortality risk of climate change under a scenario of continued high emissions to be an additional 85 deaths per 100,000 annually by 2100. For context, all cancers are responsible for approximately 125 deaths per 100,000 globally today.

Figure 3: The impact of climate change in 2100 is comparable to the contemporary leading causes of death. Impacts of climate change (coral) are calculated for the year 2100 under the high emissions scenario (SSP3-RCP8.5) and moderate emissions scenario (SSP3-RCP4.5) and include changes in death rates (solid colors) and changes in adaptation costs, measured in death-equivalents (light shading). Blue bars on the right indicate average mortality rates globally in 2018, with values from WHO (2018). 
Failing to account for income and climate adaptation, as has been the norm in the literature, would substantially overstate the mortality costs of climate change—causing an additional 221 deaths per 100,000 under a high emissions scenario, instead of 85. This mortality rate is roughly equivalent to all cardiovascular disease deaths today. Accounting for future income growth reduces the mortality risk of climate change to 104 deaths per 100,000 annually; accounting for the benefits of climate adaptation reduces it further to 73 deaths per 100,000 annually.
4. The death risk of climate change disproportionately falls on regions that are poorest and hottest today, exacerbating existing inequality.
While the average global mortality risk of climate change is equivalent to causing an additional 85 deaths per 100,000 in 2100, in Accra, Ghana, the mortality risk is roughly 160 deaths per 100,000 people. In contrast, colder and relatively wealthier Oslo, Norway, will see benefits equivalent to saving approximately 230 lives per 100,000 people. These differences reflect Oslo’s means to adapt to additional warm days, as a wealthy nation, and the benefit that the population experiences as climate change reduces the number of deadly cold days. As shown in Figure 4, in high-income places such as Oslo, the mortality-related risks of climate change are mainly damages to the economy because of increased adaptation costs. In some cases, cooler regions spend less to protect against cold-related deaths as temperatures rise, an impact that benefits the economy. In contrast, in low-income places like Accra, the damages of climate change are projected to be felt as significant increases in death rates on hot days.

Figure 4: Climate change causes increased death risk for the poor, and increased adaptation spending for the wealthy. Both panels show the change in annual mortality rates due to climate change in 2100 under continued high emissions (SSP3-RCP8.5) against deciles of 2015 per capita income. Each box indicates the interquartile range of predicted estimates, where uncertainty is calculated across 1,000 simulations. Changes in mortality rates (red) and adaptation costs (pink) are reported from poorest (decile 1) to richest (decile 10). Using a statistical metric for valuing mortality risk, the researchers measure adaptation costs in units of deaths per 100,000.
5. Across the globe, it is worth paying $36.6 per ton of CO2 to avoid the mortality impact from climate change
When mortality costs around the globe are totaled, the researchers find that the present-day value of emitting an additional ton of CO2 is $36.6 per ton under a scenario of continued high emissions. This estimate applies a 2 percent discount rate, consistent with U.S. Treasury rates over the last few decades, and method of valuing death risk that takes age into account. The likely range[2] for this value spans from -$7.8 to $73. This number is also known as the “Partial Mortality Social Cost of Carbon.” A “full” Social Cost of Carbon would encompass climate change impacts across all affected sectors of the economy. Stated another way, we should be willing to pay $36.6 per ton today to avoid the future mortality consequences of climate change. Under a scenario of moderate emissions, in which CO2 emissions are stable through 2050 and then decline, this global value falls to $17.1, with a likely range of -$24.7 to $56. The method for estimating these results differs from the U.S. government’s approach, which puts identical values on all lives lost and assumes a discount rate of 3 percent.
Applying the same valuation method and a discount rate as the Obama administration’s Interagency Working Group, the Climate Impact Lab estimates that the Partial Mortality Social Cost of Carbon for mortality is $22.1 under scenario of continued high emissions. This represents 44% of the Obama administration’s full Social Cost of Carbon—roughly $51 per ton of CO2 emitted in 2020—the most robust and credible estimate available. Previous research has attempted to tease out the value of health impacts in the three Integrated Assessment Models that underlie that estimate. Still, academic literature gives limited options for comparison. The FUND model, for example, reports values for comparable health impacts that total less than $2 (2019 USD) (Figure 5). The Climate Impact Lab’s empirically grounded damage estimates point to the need for continued revision of the Social Cost of Carbon estimates. Current U.S. policy relies on the Trump administration’s full Social Cost of Carbon, which includes only damages experienced within the U.S., assumes a 7 percent discount rate, and amounts to $7. The U.S. Government Accountability Office recently found[3] the Trump administration’s estimates do not rely on the best available science.

Figure 5: Estimates of a partial Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) for excess mortality risk from the Climate Impact Lab, compared to existing partial and full SCC estimates. Climate Impact Lab and FUND estimates account only for mortality-related costs; Obama administration and Trump administration estimates account for all sectors of climate change impacts. Trump Administration SCC values include only damages within the United States, while all others shown reflect global damages. 
Policy Implications
These results provide essential information for policymakers forming strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change because they capture the benefits, in terms of mortality, of reducing CO2 emissions. Further, the results provide estimates of the changes in mortality risk for 24,378 unique regions that together account for the entire world. Having this localized information provides key insights for policymakers at all levels of government to debate the importance and value of investing in adaptation measures. It is also important to note that the researchers’ estimate of the Partial Mortality Social Cost of Carbon suggests taking a second look at the U.S. government’s previous best assessment of future climate damages.
[1] The sum of changes in the mortality rate and adaptation costs represents the full mortality-related risk of climate change. The authors use the Value of Statistical Life to convert the dollars spent on adaptation to “death-equivalents,” which are defined as the change in the mortality rate that the population would be willing to accept in order to avoid paying higher adaptation costs.

14,"Temperature and relative humidity have opposing effects on evaporative water loss, the likely mediator of the temperature-dependence of nephrolithiasis. However, prior studies considered only dry-bulb temperatures when estimating the temperature-dependence of nephrolithiasis. We used distributed lag non-linear models and repeated 10-fold cross-validation to determine the daily temperature metric and corresponding adjustment for relative humidity that most accurately predicted kidney stone presentations during hot and cold periods in South Carolina from 1997 to 2015. We examined three metrics for wet-bulb temperatures and heat index, both of which measure the combination of temperature and humidity, and for dry-bulb temperatures: (1) daytime mean temperature; (2) 24-h mean temperature; and (3) most extreme 24-h temperature. For models using dry-bulb temperatures, we considered four treatments of relative humidity. Among 188,531 patients who presented with kidney stones, 24-h wet bulb temperature best predicted kidney stone presentation during summer. Mean cross-validated residuals were generally lower in summer for wet-bulb temperatures and heat index than the corresponding dry-bulb temperature metric, regardless of type of adjustment for relative humidity. Those dry-bulb models that additionally adjusted for relative humidity had higher mean residuals than other temperature metrics. The relative risk of kidney stone presentations at the 99th percentile of each temperature metric compared to the respective median temperature in summer months differed by temperature metric and relative humidity adjustment, and ranged from an excess risk of 8–14%. All metrics performed similarly in winter. The combination of temperature and relative humidity determine the risk of kidney stone presentations, particularly during periods of high heat and humidity. These results suggest that metrics that measure moist heat stress should be used to estimate the temperature-dependence of kidney stone presentations, but that the particular metric is relatively unimportant.",Journal Article,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117317565'],"

16,"Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).",Journal Article,['http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/356/6345/1362?ijkey=x3wZ8kcgtomUM&keytype=ref&siteid=sci'],"

17,"This paper reveals a stark inequality in the effect of ambient temperatures on death in human populations. Using district-level daily weather and annual mortality data from 1957 to 2000, we find that hot days lead to substantial increases in mortality in rural but not urban India. Despite being far poorer, the mortality response in urban India is not dissimilar to that in the US over the same period. Looking into potential mechanisms we find that the rural death effects are driven by hot days in the growing season which reduce productivity and wages in agriculture. Consistent with a model of endogenous survival in the face of credit constraints, we also find that the expansion of bank branches into rural India helped to mitigate these effects. When coupled with a climatological model that predicts many more hot days in a typical year by the end of this century, these estimates imply considerable reductions in rural Indian, but not urban Indian or US, life expectancy ceteris paribus.",Working Paper,[],"

18,"For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by ~48%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by ~11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by ~0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.",Journal Article,['http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/aad9837'],"

19,"More than three quarters of the world’s suicides occur in developing countries, yet little is known about the drivers of suicidal behavior in poor populations. I study India, where one fifth of global suicides occur and suicide rates have doubled since 1980. Using nationally comprehensive panel data over 47 years, I demonstrate that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, significantly influence suicide rates. For temperatures above 20 °C, a 1 °C increase in a single day’s temperature causes approximately 70 suicides, on average. This effect occurs only during India’s agricultural growing season, when heat also lowers crop yields. I find no evidence that acclimatization, rising incomes, or other unobserved drivers of adaptation are occurring. I estimate that warming over the last 30 years is responsible for 59,300 suicides in India, accounting for 6.8% of the total upward trend.

20,"A key strategy for agriculture to adapt to climate change is by switching crops and relocating crop production. We develop an approach to estimate the economic potential of crop reallocation using a Bayesian hierarchical model of yields. We apply the model to six crops in the United States, and show that it outperforms traditional empirical models under cross-validation. The fitted model parameters provide evidence of considerable existing climate adaptation across counties. If crop locations are held constant in the future, total agriculture profits for the six crops will drop by 31% for the temperature patterns of 2070 under RCP 8.5. When crop lands are reallocated to avoid yield decreases and take advantage of yield increases, half of these losses are avoided (16% loss), but 57% of counties are allocated crops different from those currently planted.

23,"For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by ~48%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by ~11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by ~0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.",Journal Article,['http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/aad9837'],"

27,"Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies, but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature , while poor countries respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human–natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is nonlinear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.",Journal Article,[],"

36,"Linkages between climate and mental health are often theorized but remain poorly quantified. In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico, we find that suicide rates rise 0.7% in US counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities for a 1 °C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in >600 million social media updates further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9–40 thousand additional suicides (95% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.",Journal Article,"['https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0222-x', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0222-x']","

We consider multiple types of human conflict, including both interpersonal conflict, such as assault and murder, and intergroup conflict, including riots and civil war. We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1 sd increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3%.

40,"For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by ~48%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by ~11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by ~0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.",Journal Article,['http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/aad9837'],"

41,"The immediate physical damages caused by environmental disasters are conspicuous and often the focus of media and government attention. In contrast, the nature and magnitude of post-disaster losses remain largely unknown because they are not easily observable. Here we exploit annual variation in the incidence of typhoons (West-Pacific hurricanes) to identify post-disaster losses within Filipino households. We find that unearned income and excess infant mortality in the year after typhoon exposure outnumber immediate damages and death tolls roughly 15-to-1. Typhoons destroy durable assets and depress incomes, leading to broad expenditure reductions achieved in part through disinvestments in health and human capital. Infant mortality mirrors these economic responses, and additional findings – that only female infants are at risk, that sibling competition elevates risk, and that infants conceived after a typhoon are also at risk – indicate that this excess mortality results from household decisions made while coping with post-disaster economic conditions. We estimate that these posttyphoon “economic deaths” constitute 13% of the overall infant mortality rate in the Philippines. Taken together, these results indicate that economic and human losses due to environmental disaster may be an order of magnitude larger than previously thought and that adaptive decision-making may amplify, rather than dampen, disasters’ social cost.",Working Paper,[],"

43,"Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 °C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 °C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 °C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15%.",Journal Article,['https://www.pnas.org/content/116/23/11195'],"

44,"Mechanisms such as ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliﬀ collapse may rapidly increase dis-charge from marine-based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their inﬂuence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and relative sea-level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median pro-jected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant accelera-tion of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93–243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26–98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL esti-mates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.",Journal Article,['http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000663/abstract;jsessionid=B56A08DA36D079F275518C0156E20AFE.f04t03'],"

45,"The amplification of flood frequencies by sea level rise (SLR) is expected to become one of the most economically damaging impacts of climate change for many coastal locations. Understanding the magnitude and pattern by which the frequency of current flood levels increase is important for developing more resilient coastal settlements, particularly since flood risk management (e.g. infrastructure, insurance, communications) is often tied to estimates of flood return periods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report characterized the multiplication factor by which the frequency of flooding of a given height increases (referred to here as an amplification factor; AF). However, this characterization neither rigorously considered uncertainty in SLR nor distinguished between the amplification of different flooding levels (such as the 10% versus 0.2% annual chance floods); therefore, it may be seriously misleading. Because both historical flood frequency and projected SLR are uncertain, we combine joint probability distributions of the two to calculate AFs and their uncertainties over time. Under probabilistic relative sea level projections, while maintaining storm frequency fixed, we estimate a median 40-fold increase (ranging from 1- to 1314-fold) in the expected annual number of local 100-year floods for tide-gauge locations along the contiguous US coastline by 2050. While some places can expect disproportionate amplification of higher frequency events and thus primarily a greater number of historically precedented floods, others face amplification of lower frequency events and thus a particularly fast growing risk of historically unprecedented flooding. For example, with 50 cm of SLR, the 10%, 1%, and 0.2% annual chance floods are expected respectively to recur 108, 335, and 814 times as often in Seattle, but 148, 16, and 4 times as often in Charleston, SC.",Journal Article,['http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cb3/pdf'],"

46,"Sea-level rise due to both climate change and non-climatic factors threatens coastal settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Projections of mean global sea-level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90% probability) GSL rise of 0.5–1.2 m under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4–0.9 m under RCP 4.5, and 0.3–0.8 m under RCP 2.6. Site-to-site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1-in-10” and “1-in-100” year events.",Journal Article,['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EF000239'],"

50,"Evidence increasingly suggests that as climate warms, some plant, animal, and human populations may move to preserve their environmental temperature. The distances they must travel to do this depends on how much cooler nearby surfaces temperatures are. Because large-scale atmospheric dynamics constrain surface temperatures to be nearly uniform near the equator, these displacements can grow to extreme distances in the tropics, even under relatively mild warming scenarios. Here we show that in order to preserve their annual mean temperatures, tropical populations would have to travel distances greater than 1000 km over less than a century if global mean temperature rises by 2 °C over the same period. The disproportionately rapid evacuation of the tropics under such a scenario would cause migrants to concentrate in tropical margins and the subtropics, where population densities would increase 300% or more. These results may have critical consequences for ecosystem and human wellbeing in tropical contexts where alternatives to geographic displacement are limited.",Journal Article,['https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25697'],"

53,"We present a microlevel study to simultaneously investigate the effects of variations in temperature and precipitation along with sudden natural disasters to infer their relative influence on migration that is likely permanent. The study is made possible by the availability of household panel data from Indonesia with an exceptional tracking rate combined with frequent occurrence of natural disasters and significant climatic variations, thus providing a quasi-experiment to examine the influence of environment on migration. Using data on 7,185 households followed over 15 y, we analyze whole-household, province-to-province migration, which allows us to understand the effects of environmental factors on permanent moves that may differ from temporary migration. The results suggest that permanent migration is influenced by climatic variations, whereas episodic disasters tend to have much smaller or no impact on such migration. In particular, temperature has a nonlinear effect on migration such that above 25 °C, a rise in temperature is related to an increase in outmigration, potentially through its impact on economic conditions. We use these results to estimate the impact of projected temperature increases on future permanent migration. Though precipitation also has a similar nonlinear effect on migration, the effect is smaller than that of temperature, underscoring the importance of using an expanded set of climatic factors as predictors of migration. These findings on the minimal influence of natural disasters and precipitation on permanent moves supplement previous findings on the significant role of these variables in promoting temporary migration.",Journal Article,[],"
