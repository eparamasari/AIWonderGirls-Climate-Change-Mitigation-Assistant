0,Abandoned Farmland Restoration,"['Project Drawdown describes abandoned farmland restoration as: a set of processes for restoring degraded, abandoned land to productivity and biosequestration. This solution replaces the conventional practice of abandoning degraded grassland', 'Abandonment of farmland have been increased in the last two centuries. The failure of these lands to continue to produce the desired economic benefits has forced the land owners to abandon them. The loss of the agricultural productivity of these lands poses a serious threat to food security. These lands have also lost substantial carbon from soil and biomass in the process of becoming degraded', 'Restoring these lands to productivity sequesters carbon, while bringing land back into production. This can also result in substantial reduced emissions from avoided deforestation, though that impact is not modeled here. This model looks only at agricultural restoration, though restoration to forests and other ecosystems is also practiced on abandoned farmland', 'Given the urgency of preventing emissions from deforestation, and the pressure of meeting food demand given the trend towards increasing meat consumption, abandoned farmland restoration is highly desirable. Its impressive carbon sequestration impact, along with these co-benefits, makes it an essential component of mitigation efforts', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nThe total available land for the abandoned farmland restoration solution is 371 million hectares,[1] which is allocated on degraded grasslands. Though abandoned land that has been restored is by definition now in agricultural production or is a restored forest or other ecosystem, 20 million hectares are reported to be under active restoration in globally; thus, this number is used as current adoption[2] of abandoned farmland restoration', 'It is assumed that the process of restoration takes one year, after which the land returns to production. Restored land is assumed to be in Drawdown’s regenerative annual cropping solution, as the majority of restoration measures are based on improving soil fertility through organic inputs. This area, however, is not included in the total adoption area for the regenerative annual cropping solution', 'Adoption Scenarios\nProjections on restoration of abandoned farmland are unavailable. However, abandoned farmland is a subset of degraded farmland, for which published targets are available. Thus, six custom adoption scenarios were developed, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)’s 2013 low and high targets for restoration of degraded land and historical trends available for China, EU, and Kazakhstan. In the absence of targeted data, this study assumes that both abandoned and degraded land will follow similar trends', 'Impacts of increased adoption of abandoned farmland restoration from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: The analysis of these custom scenarios shows restoration of 189.5 million hectares of abandoned farmland', 'Scenario 2: Aggressive adoption of abandoned farmland restoration yields restoration of 296.1 million hectares of abandoned farmland', '\nSequestration Model\nCarbon sequestration rates are set at 1.3 tons per hectare per year, based on meta-analysis of 31 data points from four\xa0sources', 'Financial Model\nFirst cost for the abandoned farmland restoration solution is US$561.6 per hectare,[3] based on meta-analysis of 17 data points from five\xa0sources. There is no conventional first cost for comparison, as the land is assumed to have been abandoned for some time. The net profit margin and operational cost is taken from the regenerative annual cropping model, as it is assumed that this solution will eventually adopt regenerative annual cropping practices', 'Integration\nIn the process of allocating land to solutions by Agro-Ecological Zone, it was assumed that abandoned farmland is currently degraded grassland', 'Results\nTotal adoption in the Scenario 1 is 189.5 million hectares in 2050, representing 51 percent of the total available land. Of this, 169.48 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The sequestration impact of this scenario is 12.48 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. Marginal first cost is US$98.2 billion and lifetime operational cost is US$3.2 trillion. Net savings is US$2.6 trillion. Total yield of food from this previously abandoned land is 9.2 billion metric tons between 2020 and 2050', 'Total adoption in the Scenario 2 is 296.1 million hectares in 2050, representing 80 percent of the total available land. Of this, 276.09 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The impact of this scenario is 20.32 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. Marginal first cost is US$159.9 billion and lifetime operational cost is US$5.2 trillion. Net savings is US$4.3 trillion. Total yield of food from this previously abandoned land is 15 billion metric tons between 2020-2050', 'Discussion\nBenchmarks\nProjected impacts for this solution align very closely with IPCC projections for the restoration of degraded land. The IPCC estimates an impact of 0.1–0.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030 (Smith, 2007), while the Project Drawdown model shows 0.3–0.5 gigatons per year in 2030, well within the benchmark range', 'Limitations\nFor future upgrades of this solution, it would be useful to further investigate how “abandoned farmland” is categorized and how it is distinct from degraded lands in general', 'Conclusions\nIt should be seen as somewhat embarrassing for humanity that we continue to clear land for agriculture while leaving degraded, once-fertile lands behind in an abandoned state. The multiple mitigation benefits associated with abandoned farmland restoration provide strong incentive to bring these lands back into production and care for them thereafter', '\xa0\n\n[1] Determining the total available land for a solution is a two-part process. The technical potential is based on the suitability of climate, soils, and slopes, and on degraded or non-degraded status. In the second stage, land is allocated using the Drawdown Agro-Ecological Zone model, based on priorities for each class of land. The total land allocated for each solution is capped at the solution’s maximum adoption in the Optimum Scenario. Thus, in most cases the total available land is less than the technical potential', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

1,Alternative Cement,"['Project Drawdown defines alternative cement as: the partial replacement of clinker with alternative materials (such as fly ash, slag, natural pozzolans, and calcined clays) to reduce the quantity of clinker in ordinary portland cement systems. Additionally, alternative cements as a solution includes efficiency upgrades to cement plants that produce clinker, reducing its carbon intensity. The practices of making clinker more efficiently and reducing the ratio of clinker to cement reduces the emissions as compared to conventional ordinary portland cement systems', 'In 2016, 1.46 gigatons of carbon dioxide was released as a result of cement production (Andrew, 2018). While cement is only about 10% of total volume in concrete, it is responsible for about 95 percent\xa0of the total emissions. For the Project Drawdown solution alternative cement, the forecasted demand of cement was collected from various global projections. Adoption of the solution within the global cement demand is twofold; reduction in clinker intensity\xa0and improvements to the thermal and electricity intensity of a metric ton\xa0of cement. The reduction in clinker intensity is achieved by replacing ordinary portland cement with alternative cementitious materials, or pozzolans, which also have binding capabilities. Such alternative materials include industrial waste products such as fly ash and slag, in addition to naturally occurring materials such as natural pozzolans, calcined clays, and limestone, which all have lower carbon dioxide emissions. The amount of clinker reduction is determined based upon the adoption of low clinker-to-cement ratio mix designs, of which there are many. Thermal and electricity intensity of clinker production is reduced\xa0by upgrading cement kilns to modern\xa0standards, such as the use of pre-calciners and dry-kiln technologies', 'Methodology\nTo measure the impact of alternative cement, a set of adoption scenarios was developed for low-clinker cement in the context of international cement standards (ASTM and CEM). These scenarios were then compared to a Reference Scenario that fixed the adoption of low-clinker cement at its current percentage of the market. Finally, emissions mitigation and financial results were drawn by comparing scenarios using an analyzed set of variables to describe the relative emissions and costs of ordinary portland cement and low-clinker cement', 'The availability of alternative cementitious materials to replace clinker is evaluated. A fly ash availability model is developed based upon time series supply and demand data for coal production and evaluated between 2020 and 2050 as the basis to limit future fly ash availability. The supply of other clinker-replacement materials, such as calcined clays and limestone, largely outweighs the total demand for cement into the future, so\xa0the supply of clinker replacements does not bound the model', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nHistorical data indicate\xa0that in 2018 the global cement market was about 4061 million metric tons per year with an average clinker-to-cement ratio of 0.69—or current adoption of alternative cements is\xa0at 31 percent\xa0of market. In 2050, the total global cement market is estimated at 4147 million metric tons per year with varying adoption based upon the scenario. This market is developed based on estimates from the International Energy Agency, IIASA, in addition to forecasts from peer-reviewed literature', 'Adoption Scenarios[2]\nAdoption scenarios are modeled on average total global adoption of alternative cements. Therefore, we estimate 100 percent\xa0of the TAM’s clinker-to-cement ratio decreasing from 0.69 in 2018 to between 0.46 and 0.61 by 2050. The varying clinker-to-cement ratio is based on cement standards currently adopted by the global cement industry. Impacts of increased adoption of alternative cement from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to the\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario', '\nScenario 1: In this scenario, the clinker-to-cement ratio is 0.61. This corresponds to an adoption of alternative cements equivalent to 39 percent,\xa0and the mitigation result equates to 8 gigatons of carbon dioxide abated by 2050', 'Scenario 2: In this scenario, the clinker-to-cement ratio is 0.46. This corresponds to an adoption of alternative cements equal to 54 percent,\xa0and the mitigation result equates to 16 gigatons of carbon dioxide abated by 2050', '\nFinancial Model\nThe cumulative first cost of implementing the alternative cement solution over the period 2020-2050 is approximately US$5055 billion under the Scenario 2.[1] \xa0Yet the marginal first cost of alternative cements as compared to traditional ordinary portland cement concrete is US$63.5 billion. Cost data for both conventional and solution technologies are collected from cement suppliers and peer-reviewed literature', 'Results\nThe Scenario 1 results show a mitigation impact of 8 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over the period 2020–2050.\xa0 The Scenario 2 shows a mitigation impact of 16 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over the same period', 'Discussion\nThe current study takes considers a variety of alternative cementitious materials which can reduce the clinker to cement ratio. This reduction amount is based upon international standards of cement production and includes cement types CEM II–CEM V. CEM III and CEM IV are typically used in specialties construction applications and were weighted based upon their base year adoption levels (combined to be about 10 percent). CEM II and CEM V see increased adoption to nearly 90 percent\xa0of the market, displacing all market share of CEM I (traditional OPC system) in 2050 by any of the scenarios. Because the model is not bounded by the availability of alternative binding materials, high adoption of the solution is feasible. It is expected the fly ash and slag, industrial by-products, will diminish in supply as coal power and virgin steel production decreases—a situation already being realized on the West Coast of the United States. Other alternative materials, such as calcined clays, limestone, and natural pozzolanic materials, will replace fly ash and slag. The current study for this solution does not take into account the gradual reabsorption of carbon dioxide by cementitious materials, which have the potential to recover up to 17 percent of their initial manufacturing, or cradle-to-gate, emissions (Souto-Martinez et al., 2018). Due to the pervasiveness of concrete as a construction material around the world, it was estimated that nearly 18.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions were sequestered over the period 1930-2013, thereby reducing the net greenhouse impact of cement (Xi et al., 2016). Alternative cements does not account for this carbonation, since the carbon uptake of existing concrete systems will occur regardless of the adoption of alternative cements. Additionally, alternative cements do not have the same ability as traditional OPC to sequester carbon dioxide due to different chemistries (less than 10% of initial emissions). Vulnerability of concrete structures to the corrosive effects of global warming and sea level rise (Saha & Eckelman, 2014) might create more demand for cement in the coming decades; this, too, was not considered in either the Reference Scenario or adoption forecasts', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$.']"
2,Alternative Refrigerants,"['Project Drawdown defines alternative refrigerants as\xa0the gradual replacement of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in a variety of applications by alternative refrigerants with significantly lower global warming potential (GWP), including ammonia, carbon dioxide, propane, and isobutane.\xa0\nRefrigerants are used as working fluid in commercial refrigeration systems;\xa0in household appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators;\xa0in refrigerated containers used for carrying perishable goods;\xa0as air conditioning systems onboard cars, trains, aircrafts, and ships;\xa0and in industrial cooling systems, etc. There are various classes of refrigerants.[1] Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone-depleting substances and have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol; hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are also being phased out. HFCs, which do not deplete ozone, emerged as an alternative to HCFCs and have grown to extensive use. All refrigerants have a high GWP, and their release into the environment contributes to global warming. Considering the large impact that\xa0the release of refrigerants has on global warming, world leaders have agreed to phase out HFCs and replace them with natural refrigerants with much less warming potential under the Kigali Accord of\xa0October\xa02016. Refrigerants are emitted into the environment during the production process, from refrigerant banks[2] due to leakages, and during end-of-life disposal of appliances', 'Methodology\nMeasuring the alternative refrigerants solution requires: generating a total addressable market forecast of HFC refrigerant gas emissions for the period 2020–2050 (in kilotons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per year), forecasting an adoption of replacement refrigerants and the resulting decreased emissions from reducing the amount of HFC produces, used, and released into\xa0the atmosphere for each year from 2020 to 2050, and then comparing the difference in emissions from the total market and the adoption scenarios to arrive at the results.\xa0\nEmissions from refrigerants can be reduced in five main ways:\n(i)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0lower\xa0the demand/use of appliances and thereby production of refrigerants\n(ii)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 replace\xa0refrigerants with low-warming HFCs/new cooling agents/non-HFC substances\n(iii)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Increase\xa0the refrigeration efficiency in appliances, thereby lowering the use of refrigerants\n(iv)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0control\xa0leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances by good management practices\n(v)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ensure\xa0recovery, reclaiming/recycling, and destruction of refrigerants at end of life', 'This Project Drawdown solution models the second option', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe model uses available projections for global HFC emissions across various subsectors, such as commercial, industrial, domestic, and stationary (as opposed to mobile) AC systems. Velders (2015, 2017, 2019) provides refrigerant emissions (measured in kton refrigerant – HFCs).\xa0Velders provides an\xa0upper scenario and a lower scenario. A mean scenario is also calculated.\xa0These forecasts are pre–Kigali Accord and show a steadily increasing HFC emissions profile through 2050.\xa0These scenarios become the total addressable market for the alternative refrigerants model.\xa0\nAdoption of alternative refrigerants is modeled using forecasts from the literature', 'Adoption Scenarios\nVelders and others estimate the adoption of alternative refrigerants correlated with two different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).\xa0The literature presents a low scenario and a high scenario.\xa0A mean scenario is also calculated.\xa0These three scenarios—low, mean and high—determine the PDS 1, PDS 2, and PDS 3 adoption scenarios. These were assessed in comparison to a Reference scenario, in which the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', 'Emissions Model\nIn the reference case, HFC emissions are prognosticated according to the year-over-year data provided in the literature.\xa0 Whereas the exact mix of alternative refrigerants is not determined, the average GWP of 10 is used.\xa0This is much lower than the dynamic GWP of HFCs, which nears an average GWP of 2000', 'Results\nThe total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions that can be achieved from 2020 to 2050 in the Scenario 1 are 43.5 gigatons. Scenario 2 shows a larger reduction of 50.5 gigatons from 2020 to 2050', 'Discussion\nIndirect emissions from powering refrigeration appliances is a significant component of grid emissions and is expected to increase in a warming world.\xa0Adoption of low-GWP HFC replacements with new appliances brings the potential for increases in energy efficiency.\xa0Some have estimated that the potential impact on indirect emissions may be half as much or as great as direct emissions reduction.\xa0At this time this model and report do\xa0not include a forecast for indirect emissions reduction', 'In order to achieve a global phase-down of HFCs, replacement fluids must be identified\xa0and a global refrigerant transition must be implemented. Currently, there is no single replacement fluid, and all replacements include trade-offs. The theoretically ideal refrigerant is the one that has\xa0zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and\xa0low GWP,\xa0is nontoxic and\xa0nonflammable, has appropriate thermodynamic and heat transfer properties, and is compatible with any type of lubricating oil (El-Sayed, El Morsi, and Mahmoud 2018). Hydrocarbons (HCs) satisfy all the requirements except that they are highly flammable oil (El-Sayed, El Morsi, and Mahmoud 2018)', 'Climate-friendly alternatives to HFCs are increasingly available for most uses and fall into two basic categories: “natural” or nonfluorinated substances with low GWPs, and fluorinated substances with low to mid-range GWPs (Borgford-Parnell et al., 2018). Currently\xa0there is an emphasis on ""natural refrigerants"" that are gradually being used as a replacement for refrigerants from the hydrofluorocarbon group (Zanchi, Boban, and Soldo 2019). Commercially available\xa0 natural refrigerants\xa0include: ammonia (R-717), with a GWP of near zero; hydrocarbons (HC )(e.g., propane [R-290] and isobutene [R-600a]), with GWPs of less than 4; and carbon dioxide\xa0(R-744)\xa0 (with a GWP of 1). The use of hydrocarbons (e.g., isobutane and propane ammonia and carbon dioxide)', 'Commercially available fluorinated substances include O2, the low-GWP HFCs, also known as hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs), some with GWPs of less than 1, according to the IPCC. Other alternatives include, HFC-32, with a GWP of 677, and HFC-152a, with a GWP of 138, according to the IPCC. There are also “not-in-kind” alternatives that do not involve refrigerants, such as district cooling\n\n\n\n[1] Such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-502; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) like R-22; Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R404A, R134a, and R 407; and natural refrigerants like CO2 and NH3', '\n\n[2] The total quantity of refrigerant gases in existing equipment.']"
3,Bamboo Production,"['Project Drawdown defines bamboo production as\xa0the large-scale cultivation of bamboo production for timber or other biomass uses on degraded land, which sequesters carbon in soils, biomass, and long-lived bamboo products. This solution replaces other uses of degraded lands like grassland, cropland, and forest. However, Project Drawdown has allocated this solution on degraded forestland', 'Bamboo is a woody member of the grass family that grows rapidly. Bamboo\xa0grows in a wide range of environmental conditions\xa0and sequesters carbon at a rate greater than or equal to that of many tree species. Following planting, bamboo\xa0matures much faster than trees and sprouts via rhizomes, so it does not require replanting. In fact, harvesting mature culms stimulates the growth of new shoots', 'This ""friend of the people"" has more than\xa01,500 documented uses, including\xa0building materials, paper, furniture, food, fodder, and charcoal. Though there are concerns about the invasive potential of bamboo, it should be noted that species are native\xa0to Asia, Latin America, North America, and Africa. Many of the best species are clumping types that do not run and flower extremely rarely, making invasion via both roots and seeds very unlikely', 'Bamboo production is a unique subtype of tree plantation worthy of consideration on its own substantial merits', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nCurrent adoption[1] of bamboo production is estimated at 33.5 million hectares, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2010). The total area determined suitable for bamboo production is 364 million hectares, and is composed of degraded forest.[2]\nAdoption Scenarios\nFuture adoption of \xa0bamboo production is projected \xa0based on historic regional growth rates from FAO (2010) as well as on projections from Z. Song et al. (2013). Five custom adoption scenarios are developed', 'Impacts of increased adoption of bamboo production from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: Scenario analysis shows bamboo production adoption on 103.3 million hectares of degraded land', 'Scenario 2: Aggressive adoption yields adoption of tree plantation on degraded land bamboo production on 207.83 million hectares of the allocated degraded land area', '\nSequestration Model\nThe sequestration rate of bamboo production is 2.03 tons of carbon per hectare per year, based on 12 data points from four\xa0sources. This value includes carbon sequestered in long-lived products from harvested bamboo.\xa0 Because\xa0the productive lifespan of a bamboo\xa0planting is 75–100 years, emissions from replanting are not modeled', 'Financial Model\nFirst cost of bamboo production is US$915.36 per hectare,[3] based on meta-analysis of 10 data points from six\xa0sources.

This solution is allocated on the degraded forestland\xa0assumed to be not under any production, so no financials are estimated for the conventional practice', 'Integration\nProject Drawdown’s Agro-Ecological Zone model allocates current and projected adoption of solutions to the planet’s forest, grassland, rainfed cropland, and irrigated cropland areas. Adoption of bamboo production was constrained by our higher prioritization of food production and forest restoration. Adoption of bamboo production was the fourth-highest priority in degraded forest', 'Results\nTotal adoption in Scenario 1 is 103.3 million hectares in 2050, representing 28 percent of the total available land. Of this, 69.78 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The impact of this scenario is 8.27 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. Net cost is US$52.25 billion, and lifetime operational cost is US$566.9 billion. Lifetime saving in net profit is US$1.7 trillion', 'Total adoption in Scenario 2 is 207.83 million hectares in 2050, representing 57 percent of the total available land. Of this, 174.31 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The impact of this scenario is 21.31 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. Net cost is US$161.94 billion, and lifetime operational cost is US$1443.5 billion. Lifetime saving in net profit is US$4.3 trillion', 'Discussion\nBenchmarks\nA study by Z. Song, Liu, Strömberg, Yang, & Zhang (2017) estimates current carbon\xa0sequestration in terrestrial bamboo biomes at 0.16 ± 0.9 Gt of CO2-equivalent per year. In comparison, Project Drawdown’s bamboo model results indicate annual carbon\xa0sequestration rates of 0.21–0.57 Gt of CO2-equivalent per year in 2030. While few benchmarks for the global mitigation impact of bamboo production are available, it can be considered a form of afforestation. Combining bamboo production with our other woody crop solutions,\xa0tree plantation and perennial tree crops, emissions reduction in 2030 is 1.33–2.45 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year. This is still somewhat low compared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s estimate of 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent for 2030 for afforestation, assuming a price of US$100 per ton of carbon dioxide-equivalent (Smith, 2007). This difference is due to Project Drawdown’s land allocation prioritizing agroforestry and other food-producing, high-carbon-impact land uses. In addition, a price on carbon was not modeled', 'Limitations\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \nThe rarity of reported soil sequestration rates in the literature is a key limitation.

4,Bicycle Infrastructure,"['Project Drawdown defines bicycle infrastructure as\xa0the increased installation of bicycle paths to encourage more bicycle usage in urban environments. This solution replaces the use of motorized road vehicle infrastructure (i.e., more lanes for cars and buses)', 'In 2018, just under 3 percent of urban mobility around the world was completed by bicycle, with some places, like the Netherlands, having over 30 percent of trips done by bike[1]. In the EU, where more than\xa07 percent of urban trips are completed by bicycle, the net economic benefits of bicycle infrastructure improvements have been estimated to be as high as €513 billion annually[2]. This accounts for reduced costs associated with health expenditures, congestion, fuel consumption, air pollution, and more. Research has shown that bicycle infrastructure has a significant effect on the mode of travel chosen in urban environments, most notably through the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily traveled roads and intersections\xa0and through traffic calming in residential neighborhoods', 'This analysis investigates the greenhouse gas and direct financial impacts of an increase in urban bicycle ridership through expanded implementation of bicycle infrastructure', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for bicycle infrastructure is defined as the total projected passenger-kilometers traveled in urban environments from 2020 to 2050. Implementation was assumed to be in kilometers of lanes (bicycle or car/bus/other) installed, and we assumed a fixed usage of each lane-kilometer installed, with one bicycle lane-kilometer generating 5.2 million bicycle passenger-kilometers annually', 'Adoption Scenarios\nData on existing global bicycle adoption in the literature are limited. To determine the 2018 global adoption of 898 billion passenger-kilometers, data were used from a 2015 collaborative study on cycling by the Institute for Transport and Development Policy (ITDP) and University of California-Davis (UCD), which included projections[3]', 'Impacts of increased adoption of bicycle infrastructure from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios.

This scenario was based on a total of 31 adoption estimates from eight\xa0sources. Estimates were calculated for each region, summed to determine a global value, and interpolated back to the estimated current adoption.[4]\n\nEmissions Model\nEmissions were calculated based on fuel use, but as we considered some electric modes in the two scenarios (electric cars and buses), and we also included some electricity emissions. Data for this came from the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the ITDP, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for emissions factors', 'Financial Model\nThe first costs of bicycle infrastructure adoption were estimated from 29 different lane installation cost\xa0 data points, collected from 17 sources. Operating costs were taken as the maintenance costs for road and bicycle lanes. They\xa0were much lower for bicycle lanes because\xa0the wear and tear from bicycles is lower than that from cars and buses', 'Integration\nBicycle infrastructure is considered a high-priority Project Drawdown solution, so its adoption was not limited in the integration process', 'Results\nShould global ridership increase to 3.4 trillion passenger-kilometers, or 490,000 additional kilometers of bicycle lanes over that in 2018, by 2050 (as assumed in Scenario 1), municipalities would avoid emissions of more than\xa02.56 billion tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, while providing construction savings of US$2.7 trillion and lifetime operating saving of US$827 billion. [5],[6] These financial savings compare the cost of constructing new roads and lanes for increased light-duty vehicle traffic with\xa0the cost of remodeling or renovating roads to accommodate and encourage bicycle ridership. In Scenario 2, almost 1 million additional lane-kilometers installed (i.e., to 6 trillion passenger-kilometers of ridership) would result in 6.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions avoided', 'Discussion\nThe ITDP/UCD study found that combined cycling (regular and e-bicycles) could save US$24 trillion between 2015 and 2050\xa0and avoid 225 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2050. The total bicycle and e-bicycle impact in Scenario 1 is 172 million meric tons of emissions reductions in 2050, with total construction savings of US$3 trillion from 2020 to 2050. These results are much more conservative, in part because we do not include car fuel, vehicle purchase and maintenance cost savings, and some other knock-on savings for the bicycle infrastructure solution.[7] Total bicycle and e-bicycle impact in Scenario 2 is higher, at 493 million metric tons of emissions reductions in 2050, suggesting that the ITDP/UCD adoption probably lies between our Plausible and Scenario 2s', 'Additional benefits of cycling include improved health and lower health care expenses[8] and an increase in the uptake of public transport by making more public transport stops accessible by bicycle. These benefits are of great value, and\xa0are not included in our analysis. Many factors affect the expansion of bicycle infrastructure and the rates of adoption: besides the obvious ones, such as\xa0weather, type of bike lane, and geography of the city, other attributes of the city and its residents play important roles. All of these attributes are beyond the scope of this report.

5,Biochar Production,"['Project Drawdown defines biochar as\xa0a biosequestration process for converting biomass to long-lived charcoal (and energy) that\xa0can be used as a soil amendment. This solution provides an alternative to disposing of unused biomass through burning or decomposition', 'Biochar is a carbon-rich, highly stable charcoal soil amendment produced as a by-product of pyrolysis, a bioenergy generation process. The production of biochar effectively stabilizes photosynthetic carbon by abating emissions that would occur if biomass feedstocks were allowed to follow their typical decomposition and disposal pathways, particularly for the great quantity of crop residues that are burned today', 'Applying biochar to soils further stabilizes its carbon by protecting it from alternate loss pathways and can reduce other soil greenhouse gas emissions (though this emissions reduction impact is not modeled in this study). In infertile soils, such as sandy soils with low cation exchange capacity, biochar can reduce loss of nutrients through leaching', 'Biochar is something of a new category and is not precisely replacing a current practice, but can be seen as an alternative to other uses of biomass, such as burning', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nTotal demand for biochar in 2050 is estimated at 1615.57 million metric tons. Current biochar production is estimated at 0.0075 million metric tons. Biochar availability was calculated using the method (residue production = grain production * straw-to-grain ratio) given for crop residue estimation from the crop production by Lal (2005) and Woolf (2010). Crop production data were\xa0taken for the years 1991, 2001, and 2014, and future availability of biochar\xa0was estimated by the interpolation of this data set', 'The implementation unit for this solution is biochar production facilities', 'Future adoption of biochar production\xa0was based on interpolation of data from biochar sales data from 2013 to 2015 (International Biochar Initiative, 2015). Four custom scenarios were developed', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of biochar production\xa0from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario leads to the production of 6,487.8 biochar production facilities', 'Scenario 2: Because\xa0the carbon benefits of biochar are much higher than those of crop residues left lying on the fields, an aggressive production of 12527.3 biochar production facilities was considered under this scenario', '\nEmissions, Sequestration, and Yield Model\nAvoided emissions from biochar are estimated at 0.95 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per metric ton of feedstock. This reflects the amount of carbon dioxide-equivalent sequestered in the form of biochar\xa0that would otherwise have been emitted from the biomass used as feedstock if it had been burned or decomposed. This figure is the result of meta-analysis of 13 data points from five\xa0sources', 'An 18 percent yield gain was modeled for biochar-amended soils, based on figures used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)', 'Financial Model\nThe first cost per biochar production facility is US$21.63 million.[1] This is based on meta-analysis of 11 data points from three\xa0review sources. Operating costs are US$194 per metric ton of biochar produced, based on meta-analysis of 14 data points from three\xa0review sources. These figures are not comparable with a conventional practice, as biochar production represents a new industry', 'Integration\nA key constraint for this solution is the total availability of biomass feedstock. The model assumes that the maximum feedstock available is 50 percent of crop residues that are currently burned, with no dedicated feedstock production. This is because crop residues are utilized in solutions like conservation agriculture, and in the model all dedicated biomass feedstocks are used in biomass energy production, with none available for biochar production', 'Results\nTotal adoption in Scenario 1 is 6487.8 biochar production facilities producing 133 million metric tons of biochar by 2050. This represents 8 percent of the total addressable market. Climate impact is 2.22 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent sequestered from 2020 to 2050. Net cost is US$195.87 billion and lifetime operational cost is US$734.05 billion', 'Total adoption in Scenario 2 is 12,527.3 biochar production facilities producing 256.8 million metric tons of biochar by 2050. This represents 16 percent of the total addressable market. Climate impact is 4.39 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent sequestered from 2020 to 2050. Net cost is US$383.30 billion and lifetime operational cost is US$1.4 trillion', 'Discussion\nBenchmarks\nClimate impacts produced by the Project Drawdown model (0.1–0.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year in 2050) are much lower than a benchmark reported by the IPCC, which estimates 3.67 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year (2014). This is in part based on their estimate of 1.01 gigatons of biomass carbon, four times higher than our maximum feedstock estimate for the Project Drawdown scenario. This benchmark also includes impacts of soil sequestration from biochar application, which this study determined was lacking sufficient data to model effectively', 'Limitations\nThe biochar production solution has a number of limitations, most based in the nascent state of the industry. A key area is biomass feedstock availability, which would be useful to model across the many solutions that utilize it (e.g., clean cookstoves, biomass power, conservation agriculture). Availability of more robust data on the soil sequestration impact of biochar application would also be useful. More financial data, particularly revenues and profit margins, will be key to economic projections. Future studies could also model the energy production impact of biochar production', 'Conclusions\nFor a period of time, biochar\xa0was billed as a “silver bullet”\xa0to mitigate climate change. While our model certainly does not show this to be the case, biochar production has an important role to play in biosequestration and soil fertility improvement', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$.']"
6,Biogas for Cooking,"['Project Drawdown defines biogas for cooking as\xa0methane digester technologies that produce biogas for household heating through the anaerobic digestion of organic waste. This solution replaces fuelwood, charcoal, or even fossil fuel-based cookstoves, and helps mitigate their emissions', 'Anaerobic digestion is a biological process that produces a gas (biogas) principally composed of methane and carbon dioxide. Methane digesters come in a variety of\xa0tank designs to capture methane and combust it to create heat. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels or solid biomass fuel, while also mitigating fugitive methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the anaerobic breakdown of manure', 'In the Project Drawdown model, the manure and crop waste fed into digesters is from the cattle and farm owned by the household so there is no fuel cost, but some maintenance is required', 'Methodology\nThis analysis focuses only on three developing regions: Middle East and\xa0Africa, Asian sans Japan, and Latin America. To derive mitigation impact results and financial considerations for biogas for cooking, several steps were taken. First, a forecast was calculated for the total final cooking energy for the included regions from 2014 to 2050, measured in terawatt-hour therms. Then, current adoption[1] of small methane digesters was determined, future adoption scenarios were forecast for that period based on the availability of waste to feed digesters, an emissions mitigation value was derived in terawatt-hour therms per digester per year, and the emissions mitigation and costs were calculated compared with\xa0a Reference Scenario that\xa0keeps methane digester adoption at its current percentage of the cooking energy demand', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market is defined as the total terawatt-hour therms final energy used for cooking in all regions except OECD90 and Eastern Europe (that is, Middle East and\xa0Africa, Asian sans Japan, and Latin America). From the literature review, assumptions were derived for population growth, average population per household, average household useful energy use for cooking per capita, a weighted average energy efficiency factor for stove and fuel type mix, and the percentage of the population using solid fuels. These values, along with global data from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2006 and 2012), were used to develop a composite global market for the period 2014–2050', 'Adoption Scenarios\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nCurrent adoption and future adoption scenarios for biogas for cooking were created by\xa0taking the population of cattle, buffalo, and pigs as well as major crop waste by type (maize, paddy rice, sugar cane, and wheat) for each country in Asia (sans Japan), Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s most recent database; estimating a certain waste production per day (minus a feasibility factor of what is collectable); then factoring in an average daily waste input requirement for a functioning digester. The result was a total potential capacity for small methane digesters per each region. Current data on the number of installed digesters were\xa0used to derive current adoption and indicated that 32.5 percent, 0.3 percent, and 0.0 percent of the technical potentials of Asian (sans Japan), Middle East and\xa0Africa, and Latin America, respectively were adopted', 'Impacts of increased adoption of biogas for cooking from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels. Potential for each region was\xa0based on the total potential capacity if waste from all animals and crops were used', '\nScenario 1: For this scenario, it is assumed that each region in question achieves the current adoption in the region Asia (sans Japan): 32.5 percent of its possible capacity, and Asia (sans Japan) doubled its adoption by 2050 in percent terms', 'Scenario 2: This scenario assumes that each region achieves the current adoption in China—50 percent of its possible capacity, and Asia (sans Japan) achieves 100 percent of its capacity', '\nNote that capacity here is limited by availability of animal and plant waste not demand for cooking energy', 'Emissions Model\nBy avoiding methane and nitrous oxide emissions through the use of small methane digesters and the replacement of inefficient fuelwood cookstoves, each digester reduces around 1.25–2.95 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per year (Zhang et al., 2013; Izumi et al., 2016). Because of leakages and biogas burning, emissions from small methane digesters amount to around 0.02 kilograms of carbon dioxide per megajoule of cooking energy produced (Zhang et al., 2013). No substantial double-counting or integration effects were factors in generating the results for this solution', 'Financial Model\nThe cost of small methane digesters depends on the country of installation, the size, the design, and the material used, and ranges from US$300 in Costa Rica to US$1200 in Kenya.[2] The operational cost of small methane digesters is very low because\xa0the manure is almost free of cost, but there is a need for regular maintenance. Maintenance costs range\xa0from US$0.01 to US$0.08 per kilowatt-hour (Ghimire, 2005;\xa0Shailendra et al., 2015). High initial capital costs, improper construction leading to high maintenance or repair costs, and inadequate operator training are the main barriers to large-scale adoption of small methane digesters (GACC, 2016)', 'Most of the cost of traditional stoves has been obtained from sources such as the World Bank and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Weighting based on cooking fuel mix was applied to all costs', 'Results\nIf 57 million traditional stoves are replaced with small biogas reactors, the total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions from 2020 to 2050 in Scenario 1 would be 4.65 gigatons, with a cumulative first cost of US$25\xa0billion to implement, albeit with an increase of US$100 billion in lifetime operating costs since traditional stoves have few financial costs since often women collect firewood over several hours per day for free. Scenario 2 shows a mitigation of 9.7 gigatons from 2020 to 2050 with 87 million biogas stoves at a cost of US$52\xa0billion.\xa0 Again, lifetime operating costs are higher by US$209 billion', 'Discussion\nSmall methane digesters have the potential to provide reliable, carbon emissions-mitigating household heating across the world for cooking and other uses.\xa0 The major risk associated with adoption is disrepair and fugitive emissions. Creative feedstock switching and community-scale aggregating are in development to increase the overall technical feasibility, which is currently the limiting factor for the technology.\xa0\nNote: August 2021 corrections appear in\xa0boldface', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018. This study uses 2014 as the base year', '\n\n[2] All monetary values presented are in 2014 US$.']"
7,Biomass Power,"['Project Drawdown defines biomass power as\xa0the use of perennial biomass feedstock for dedicated electricity generation and combined heat and power generation. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Considering their variety of potential uses, it is important to consider the development and deployment of perennial crops as an alternative to annual bioenergy crops. Perennials are generally defined by their lifetime of three\xa0or more years. Various life-cycle assessment studies (Searchinger et al., 2008; DeCicco et al., 2016) have\xa0shown that annual bioenergy crops such as corn are not much better than fossil fuel energy sources in terms of climate and energy impacts. Perennial grasses, on the other hand, have naturally high productivity, need fewer chemicals and water, and are not food crops; hence, many governments worldwide are choosing them as future energy farming systems (El Bassam, 2010)', 'Methodology\nThis analysis focuses on perennial biomass power. It\xa0models both woody and herbaceous plants as the main source of feedstock for dedicated electricity generation and combined heat and power generation', 'Total Addressable Market\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solution, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration. The total addressable market for electricity generation technologies using perennial crops as feedstock is based on estimated global electricity generation from 2020 to 2050. Current adoption[1] is estimated at 0.28 percent of generation (73 terawatt-hours). This number is derived from solid biofuels and bagasse data (IRENA), applying a factor of 20.2 percent obtained through a meta-analysis of data from several sources (El Bassam, 2010; NREL, 2011; Turconi et al., 2013)', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of biomass power from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario follows a medium growth trajectory derived from the biomass and waste electricity generation projections of IEA (2017) Energy Technology Perspectives 2DS and B2DS scenarios; IEA (2018) World Energy Outlook SDS; and Equinor (2018) renewal scenario using a medium growth trajectory. The share of biomass from these values is estimated to be 77.8 percent, of which 20.2 percent is assumed to use perennial biomass as a feedstock. This scenario results in a 1.1\xa0percent market share for biomass power within the electricity-generation technologies mix in 2050', 'Scenario 2: This scenario takes a high growth adoption trajectory from the same above-mentioned scenarios and sources. This scenario accounts for 0.86 percent share of the electricity generation portfolio in 2050 under a significantly higher total addressable market', '\nFinancial Model\nFinancial assumptions for biomass power were used from many peer-reviewed sources to determine capital and operating costs. Emissions were estimated based on a few studies that focused on electricity production from perennial feedstock such as miscanthus and willow short-rotation coppice. The financial inputs used in the model assume an average installation cost of US$3386 per kilowatt[2] with a learning rate of 7.6 percent, reducing the cost to US$2928 per kilowatt in 2030 and to US$2723 in 2050. This is compared with\xa0a weighted average of US$1786 per kilowatt for conventional technologies such as coal, natural gas, and oil power plants. An average capacity factor of 69 percent was used for the solution, compared with\xa057 percent for conventional technologies. Variable operation and maintenance costs of US$0.012 per kilowatt-hour and of US$91.39 \xa0per kilowatt for fixed costs are considered for biomass power technologies, compared to US$0.005 and US$34.7, respectively, for the conventional technologies. An average fuel cost used in the modelling for the biomass plants is US$0.0143 per kilowatt-hour, compared with\xa0US$0.049 per kilowatt-hour for an weighted average of the conventional fuels', 'Integration\nThrough the process of integrating biomass with other solutions, the market for electricity generation technologies was adjusted to account for reduced demand resulting from the growth of more energy-efficient technologies,[3] as well as increased electrification from other solutions such as\xa0electric cars\xa0and high-speed rail. Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity-generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'A straightforward comparison of the adoption and emissions results with other sources is not possible, due to the specificities of the feedstock considered herein, since all other global energy system models consider aggregate numbers for biomass and waste', 'Results\nThe results for Scenario 1 show that the marginal first costs compared to the Reference Scenario would be US$51.1 billion from 2020 to 2050, with nearly US$216 billion in lifetime savings from the electricity-generating biomass power plants installed in the same period. Increasing the use of this solution from approximately 0.28 percent in 2018 to 1.1 percent of world electricity generation by 2050 would require an estimated US$250.9 billion in cumulative first costs. Under Scenario 1, this solution could reduce 2.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2050, compared with\xa0the\xa0Reference Scenario', 'Scenario 2 assumes an higher growth of perennial biomass for generation technologies, with impacts on greenhouse gas emissions reductions over 2020–2050 of 3.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent', 'Discussion\nBearing in mind the portfolio of other renewable energy technologies available, around 1 percent of electricity generation from perennial feedstocks for biomass power in 2050 still comprises a significant portion of global electricity demand. While the carbon savings may not be tremendous, the modelling did not account for electricity generation technologies with carbon capture and storage. Despite the robust adoption projections for total biomass and waste, the mix of electricity-generating technologies (co-firing or dedicated biomass, pure electricity or co-generation) or fuels (wood pellets, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, synthetic gas, biogas), and the share of perennial crops used, bring significant levels of uncertainty', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand (i.e. TWh) supplied by the solution in 2018', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$. \xa0\n\n\n[3] For example,\xa0LED lighting and high efficiency heat pumps']"
8,Bioplastics,"['Project Drawdown defines bioplastics\xa0as\xa0replacing petroleum-based plastics with biomass feedstock–based plastic materials (also referred to as biopolymers). This solution replaces traditional plastics made from petroleum', 'The fossil-based system of plastics manufacturing is characterized by the extraction of hydrocarbons from the Earth and the use of this fossil resource as a raw material to create different plastic products. The agricultural process uses carbon dioxide taken in by plants through photosynthesis; the plants are\xa0harvested and used to create bioplastics. The carbon in these materials is known as biogenic carbon. Climate emissions reductions from bioplastics are achieved through the atmospheric origin of the carbon within the materials themselves\xa0and through keeping production impacts low enough to realize the benefits of the biogenic carbon', 'Methodology\nTo arrive at the results for mitigation impact and financial considerations for bioplastics, several steps were taken. 1) A forecast was calculated for the total million metric tons of plastics production from 2014 to 2050.\xa02) Current adoption[1] of bioplastics was determined.\xa03) Future adoption scenarios of bioplastics were forecast for that period.\xa04) An emissions mitigation value was derived per million metric tons of bioplastics produced.\xa05) The emissions mitigated and costs were calculated in comparison to a Reference Scenario that keeps bioplastics\xa0adoption at its current percentage of global plastics adoption', 'Total Addressable Market[2]\nThe total addressable market for plastics was measured by finding a best-fit trend line (using a third-order polynomial expression) among four different data sets of forecasted plastics adoption from 2020 to 2050. The four data sets were derived primarily from PlasticsEurope (2019) and the World Economic Forum (2016), using different growth rates and benchmarks to inform extrapolation', 'Adoption Scenarios[3]\nImpacts of increased adoption of bioplastics\xa0from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to the\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario mentioned above', 'Custom adoption scenarios for bioplastics were created by\xa0using Project Drawdown’s land use models to set plausible land use for generating bioplastic feedstock; considering the municipal solid waste fractions that could plausibly be attributed to recyclable or compostable plastics; and taking existing prognostications from European Bioplastics (2018) that could be extrapolated.\xa0 Scenarios were generated using third-order polynomial extrapolations, and a ceiling was fixed on adoption based on the other factors described', 'For bioplastics, two scenarios were developed:\n\nScenario 1: The bioplastics market grows to 92 million metric tons, or 12 percent\xa0of the total plastics market of 782 million metric tons in 2050', 'Scenario 2: Bioplastics grows to 357 million metric tons, \xa0or 46 percent of the market in 2050.\xa0\n\nEmissions Model\nUsing values from more than\xa025 studies, an average difference in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions between traditional plastics and bioplastics\xa0was generated. A weighted average based on type of plastic and market share results in approximately 0.933 units of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per unit of bioplastics produced, compared with\xa0traditional plastics, which have direct emissions of approximately 2.4. Despite the large potential for improvement in bioplastic technologies in the coming years, this emissions reduction value is assumed to stay constant over the 30-year time frame that was modeled.\xa0\nFinancial Model\nProduction costs used for this solution for both traditional plastics and bioplastics are based on the most currently available price data and a projection for prices in 2020 from the literature (Shen, 2009, Biron, 2015, Rorrer 2017, Ashok 2018). The data found within the literature, via email, and in online market reports from 2011 to 2015 were\xa0averaged to estimate current market prices\xa0and\xa0combined with future estimates for polypropylene and bioplastics in an attempt to accommodate both historical prices and future trends within the model. Rather than try to predict undulations in the market, a static price was assigned over the next 30 years, which is assumed to be an approximation of the average price in that time frame', 'Integration[4]\nAs already noted, integration with other Project Drawdown solutions has limited the adoption of bioplastics\xa0by cropland available to be allocated to the production of bioplastic feedstocks. Assumptions are also made as to what portion of bioplastics is compostable and what is recyclable, in order to adjust the market for composting and recycling as well as to adjust the fraction of waste, low heat value, and degradable carbon remaining to be used in waste-to-energy and landfill methane capture solutions', 'Results\nThe total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions that can be achieved from 2020 to 2050 in Scenario 1 are 0.96 gigatons, with a cumulative first cost of production of US$2065 billion. Scenario 2 shows a mitigation of 3.8 gigatons from 2020 to 2050.\xa0\nDiscussion\nBioplastics are nascent technologies and will continue to develop. As such, there are some areas of uncertainty regarding the model and there is room for improvement in future iterations. While there was quite a bit of literature dedicated to measuring the climate impacts of fossil plastics and bioplastics, there are many different types of bioplastics, each with different feedstocks and production techniques. The current model aggregates all plastics and biopolymers into two generalized groups, but future versions should consider each different polymer type and production method. The same holds true for prices that were aggregated in the same manner', 'Additional work could also be done on a robust financial breakdown of plastic commodities and feedstock availability, including a techno-economic analysis of bioplastics. Production models could also include more nuanced data regarding geographical production rates, recycling rates, and source reductions, even if they are already accounted for in the aggregate in this version of the model. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that the bioplastics market can grow to replace a significant portion of traditional plastics, while reducing climate emissions', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study. This study uses 2014 as the base year due to the availability of global adoption data for all Project Drawdown solutions evaluated.']"
9,Building Automation Systems,"['Project Drawdown defines building automation systems\xa0as\xa0automated control systems that can regulate a building’s heating and cooling, lighting, appliances, and more to maximize energy efficiency and/or worker productivity. This solution would replace buildings with conventional pneumatic or electric control systems', 'Because of their large share of energy consumption, residential and commercial buildings now account for one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. An efficiency technology that has historically been common in large commercial buildings is a building automation system (BAS). Though many large commercial buildings in the US\xa0and EU have some form of building automation or management system, these systems are often not based on the most recent technologies', 'Recent trends in building system integration and automation have caused increased interest around the future of BAS technologies, but this is an area that remains understudied. The benefits of these BAS for large commercial buildings and, increasingly, for small- and medium-size\xa0buildings are significant because\xa0they can reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings by up to 40 percent (IEA, 2013). The model presented examines the financial and emissions impact of high BAS adoption instead of conventional system use', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for BAS was considered to be the total floor area of commercial building space worldwide broken out by Project Drawdown region; adoption was therefore defined as the total commercial floor area in each region that is managed by a BAS system.

These were summed to get the global adoption', 'Scenario 2: Logistic s-curves were applied to each Project Drawdown region, with assumptions on the adoption in 2050: 100 percent adoption in the OECD, 80 percent adoption in China, 50 percent everywhere else. These were summed to get the global adoption', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions included in the results below are electricity consumption for cooling, heating, and nonthermal end uses as well as fuel use for heating. For this, global average commercial building energy consumption rates as well as efficiency rates for BAS were collected from a range of sources especially from the International Energy Agency (IEA).[3] \xa0Emissions factors were obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs for BAS\xa0installation were estimated at US$22.74 per square meter[4], based on 20 data points.

Operating costs included\xa0building heating and cooling energy (fuel and electricity)\xa0and other electricity use. Fuel and electricity prices were averaged over 2007–2018', 'Integration\nProject Drawdown’s BAS solution was integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing the solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions such as\xa0insulation were first, building systems like BAS were second, and building applications such as\xa0heat pumps were last. Thus, the BAS\xa0energy saving potential was reduced to represent the prior energy savings of higher-priority solutions', 'Results\nProject Drawdown’s Scenario 1 adoption of BAS\xa0avoids over 6.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

10,Building Retrofitting,"['Project Drawdown defines building\xa0retrofitting as\xa0the renovation of building components (including building envelope, appliances, and controls) to include high-efficiency solutions. This replaces the conventional practice of retrofitting buildings with conventional solutions.\xa0\nBuilding retrofits can be undertaken in myriad ways, initiated by the building owner, the manager, the tenant, or an external party, and with a suite of different financing models. The most suitable measures can also vary considerably, depending on the climate and the building location, shape, and form. Most building retrofitting\xa0focuses on either passive design measures such as improving the building envelope (e.g., installing better insulation and double-pane window glazing), or active design measures to improve the efficiency of lighting; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC);\xa0water heating;\xa0and plug loads', 'Methodology\nBuilding retrofitting encompasses several solutions in the Buildings Sector that Project Drawdown has modeled individually. Building retrofits can involve installing better insulation, energy-efficient glazing, more efficient lighting, heat pumps, and efficient water heating. Since these solutions were modeled separately, retrofitting was not modeled in order to avoid double-counting. Modeling building retrofitting was also impractical, since building retrofits vary greatly depending on the size of the building, its location, the climate where the building is located, and other factors', 'Results\nThe emissions and financial impacts of building retrofitting are included in individual solutions in order to avoid double counting.\xa0\nDiscussion\nWhile many initiatives focus on new buildings, in most countries the majority of the buildings that will make up the urban environment by 2030 already exist. Improving building energy efficiency is one of the most cost-effective and fastest ways to reduce electricity demand and associated fuel imports, while indirectly slashing carbon emissions as well as improving local air quality and public health. Energy-efficient buildings are also believed to be healthier buildings, resulting in lower health-related absenteeism or productivity drops. Building retrofitting is increasingly used for public relations and brand management, contributing to a company’s social license to operate, while the green credentials can often also be used to satisfy reporting, procurement, or investment requirements. A retrofitted building is therefore less likely to lose value and be subject to functional obsolescence. For all these reasons, retrofitting for the world’s existing commercial, industrial and residential buildings is compelling', 'Often, building the case for building retrofitting also means proving the value of investing in energy savings beyond the simple ""energy cost savings""\xa0story. To do so, it is helpful to tap into what really motivates key decision-makers and show them how energy efficiency can contribute to those goals. The rise of better financing and contracting models that mitigate or eliminate the risk and burden of high up-front cost and somewhat uncertain operational cost savings, as well as schemes that provide incentives to utilities to help their customers save rather than consume more energy, are also increasingly important drivers for greater uptake of\xa0energy-efficiency building\xa0retrofitting. In addition, a number of global trends are likely to drive interest in building retrofitting. For example, new building risks have emerged, such as increased volatility of fuel prices for electricity generation and energy insecurity from dependencies on scarce fossil resources and the locations from which these are sourced.']"
11,Carpooling,"['Project Drawdown defines the carpooling solution as\xa0increasing urban car occupancy worldwide. This solution replaces the urban conventional practice of using single-occupancy vehicles', 'Car occupancy is a key metric for efficient use of cars. Cars are very space intensive in that they are a key cause of congestion in cities. Efficiencies of car use can approach that of buses if enough people share cars for the same trips. This we call carpooling, and interpret it for all urban car trips. Carpooling is often mainly associated with commuting in North America, but there is much potential for it to reduce emissions worldwide for a variety of trip purposes. Implementing or stimulating carpooling includes use of high occupancy-vehicle (HOV) and high occupancy-tolling (HOT) lanes, HOV priority parking, shared taxis, and shared ride hailing (Uber, Lyft, etc.). Ride-hailing systems often are used as single user taxis, which doesn’t increase car occupancy; however the shared version of these services (UberPOOL,\xa0Lyft Shared Rides, etc.) can increase occupancy if well implemented, and is considered carpooling in this analysis', 'Methodology\nIn this study, carpooling trips are compared with\xa0single-occupancy car trips. A fully adopted carpooling trip is considered as three\xa0passengers sharing a trip[1]. We therefore assume that each car trip either has one\xa0or three\xa0passengers for the purpose of modeling. Data on car mode share and average car occupancy are used to estimate urban vehicle trips worldwide. Global car occupancy is estimated at 1.57 persons per trip,[2] which would indicate 29 percent current adoption[3] of carpooling as defined. Changes to car occupancy are assumed to result from the approaches listed above implemented worldwide by policymakers, alongside a cultural shift that embraces sharing of trips and that is partly supported by technology that reduces the stigma and perceived safety issues. Increased occupancy targets for 2050 are set with annual increases from the current value and, each year, the average occupancy is used to estimate the number of trips that have fully adopted carpooling compared with\xa0those that are single occupancy', 'Total Addressable Market[4]\nThe total addressable market for carpooling is estimated as the total passenger-kilometers of urban travel globally after the non-car solutions have been adopted (that is, the estimated car-only urban mobility worldwide). Note that this declines in more aggressive scenarios as more sustainable modes like public transit take more mode share', 'Adoption Scenarios[5]\nImpacts of increased adoption of carpooling from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s mode share was fixed at the current percent levels. In each scenario, an adopted carpooling trip is defined as one with\xa0 three people sharing the trip', '\nScenario 1: This scenario projects that the global average car occupancy will be 1.75 in 2050, and hence will grow linearly from 1.57 to that value', 'Scenario 2: This scenario projects that the global average car occupancy will be 2.0 in 2050, and hence will grow linearly from 1.57 to that value', '\nFinancial Model\nAs carpooling is defined here, there are no first costs to adopting the practice. However, an operating cost difference is included: with fewer cars on the road, the maintenance and fuel (and for EV’s, electricity) costs per passenger-kilometer are reduced, as they are assumed constant per vehicle-kilometer driven.[6] The average single occupancy vehicle operating cost is divided by the car occupancy, which represents a 67 percent drop (from costs per single occupancy traveler to costs per three\xa0carpooling travelers). The price of fuel is the average of data from 2007 to 2018 and comes from International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy Prices data. The electricity grid prices come from over 500 data points from several countries over 10 years', 'Integration[7]\nAs mentioned earlier, the carpooling total addressable market\xa0only considers the urban mobility after all more sustainable solutions are adopted (walking, biking, public transit), so the mobility markets are shared among all these solutions. A major element of integration here is how the other car solutions (electric cars, hybrid cars) interact with the carpooling solution. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases, the effect of carpooling[8] is reduced since EVs are more efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. More specifically, the energy type shifts increasingly from gasoline to electricity. Similarly, as carpooling adoption increases, the average car occupancy of EVs increases, leading to a reduced impact of electric cars. Similar logic applies to hybrid cars\xa0as they relate to carpooling. These have been taken into account. In addition, it was ensured that the same car inputs were used across relevant Transport Sector models (emissions factors, fuel economy, etc.)', 'Results\nScenario 1 results in a total reduction of 7.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases, and operating savings of US$5.2 trillion.[9] Scenario 2 shows a reduction of 4.2 gigatons of emissions and US$2.6 trillion in car operating costs for consumers, which are lower since the total car mobility is lower due to more use of walking, biking, and public transit. To put these results another way: a three-person family always driving together instead of using their three\xa0family cars individually would save more than\xa03.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide, and over US$2,000, in a year[10]', 'Discussion\nThe financial costs of travel are motivators for carpooling, but history shows that increased carpooling in North America is driven most forcefully by external forces rather than by policies designed to promote carpooling. Carpooling for commuting has declined from highs of 30 percent in the US to under 10 percent, but some recently introduced services may help stimulate growth.[11] In North America and Europe, there is still a stigma attached to sharing rides with strangers. Shared ride hailing only accounts for less than one fifth of ride-hailing services, partly due to the added inconvenience, but also to\xa0perceived safety risks. Uber announced that almost 6,000 sexual assaults and 107 deaths were reported on its services for 2017 and 2018. This remains an important concern for many, but Uber’s report also noted that the rate of sexual assault and fatality is lower than the US national average.[12]\nOn the contrary, carpooling has been popular in developing word\xa0countries for financial reasons. In many countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, the sharing of taxis (“bush taxis,”\xa0“route taxis,”\xa0“taxis collectifs,”\xa0or “carros públicos”) on special, often fixed or semi-fixed, routes for short or longer distance journeys has been around for decades and has\xa0been popular since it\xa0helps reduce costs for travelers and allows drivers to adapt to market demand.[13] However, with rising incomes, car ownership has been rising worldwide, and this is likely to lead to lower pooling of rides. Around 80 million cars are sold annually, and an increasing share of them are sport utility vehicles (SUVs), which consume more fuel than smaller vehicles. China is already the world’s largest car market, with India, Mexico, and Brazil being other large buyers. Overall, the world is moving away from, rather than toward,\xa0carpooling and shared rides for urban mobility', 'There is hope, however, because of the availability of appropriate urban policy, a growing acceptance of sharing trips by younger travelers partly for environmental reasons, a growing movement for Mobility as a Service (MaaS), as well as\xa0the projections from the scientific community of the critical need for shared mobility to avoid gridlock in an era with self-driving cars. All of these are strong drivers that will help grow carpooling', '\n\n\n[1] We exclude a nonpassenger driver from that calculation', '\n\n[2] ICCT (2012) Global Roadmap Model v1.0, www.theicct.org, accessed 1 September, 2017', '\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

14,Composting,"['Project Drawdown defines composting as\xa0the conversion of biodegradable waste to a useful soil amendment\xa0while avoiding emissions from landfills. This solution replaces the disposal of biodegradable waste in landfills', 'Organic wastes account for 46 percent\xa0of global solid waste and contribute, on average, 469 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases per million metric tons of organic solid waste due to anaerobic breakdown resulting in methane emissions. Composting is a flexible, scalable approach that reduces those emissions by more than 50 percent. Project Drawdown has defined the composting solution based on urban organic waste that is largely being managed today via landfills and, in some regions, open dumping. The mitigation impact reported by\xa0Project Drawdown for this solution does not consider any potential carbon biosequestration benefits from the use of compost as a soil amendment, nor any potential savings from reducing demand for nitrogen fertilizers', 'Methodology\nTo arrive at the mitigation and financial results for composting, a forecast for the total global urban organic waste production from 2014–2050 was first calculated. Next, the current composting rate of existing municipal solid waste was determined, the future plausible adoption of composting was forecast to 2050, and the emissions mitigated were calculated in comparison to a Reference Scenario that keeps adoption of composting fixed at the current percentage of global organic waste', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nThe total addressable market for organic waste is defined based on the global urban organic waste production from 2014 to 2050. The global market was calculated using a composite of forecasts, including a linear interpolation of World Bank data from 2010 to 2025, an extrapolation to extend those projections to 2050, and a per capita extrapolation[2] using IPCC data. It is expected that by 2050, global organic waste will be around 1979 million metric tons. Current adoption[3] of composting in the year 2014 was estimated to be 13 percent\xa0of urban organic waste', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nDue to the lack of reliable future projections of the growth of composting, adoption estimates were made based on present urban composting rates in the US and Europe—approximately 38 percent\xa0and 57 percent, respectively—with negligible rates in developing and least-developed countries', 'Impacts of increased adoption of composting from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0the\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario mentioned above', '\nScenario 1: For this scenario, it is assumed that composting will increase from present rates to 38 percent\xa0in middle- and low-income countries, and to 57 percent\xa0in high-income (OECD) countries by 2050. Globally, compost production increases from 106 million metric tons per year in 2015 to 758 million metric tons per year in 2050', 'Scenario 2: Here, it is assumed that composting scale and costs are optimized, the market value of compost increases, and source-separated collection is subsidized.[5] In this scenario, the amount of compost produced in 2050 is 956 million metric tons', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions data for each scenario were\xa0calculated using variables selected from sources that\xa0measured the comparative emissions of composting and/or landfilling. The variables were normalized to total direct emissions per million metric tons of organic waste, as a variety of sources reported complete emissions and some segmented emissions data by collection, transportation, processing, and other indirect measures.[6]\nFinancial Model\nFinancial results were reached by comparing the costs of creating and operating compost facilities with those of\xa0creating and operating sanitary landfills for an equivalent volume of organic waste. Collection and transportation costs were assumed to be the same for each approach. The cost of establishing new compost facilities over the period in question is calculated to be US$110 billion, which is US$61 billion less than the cost of establishing new landfills.[7]\xa0 However, operating compost facilities costs more than operating landfills, even considering the revenue generated from the sale of finished compost. The data used for modeling both composting and landfilling was generated based on a mix of values, including worldwide averages reported by World Bank’s “What a Waste” and the UN\xa0Environment Programme (UNEP)', 'Integration[8]\nFor integration, Project Drawdown first considered the reduction of organic waste from reduced food waste and the increase in organic waste from an assumed compostable percentage of the increased adoption of bioplastic, to refactor the market for composting for each year.[9]\xa0 Modeled compost adoption was then compared with\xa0the new organic waste market and adjusted if needed.[10]\nResults\nProject Drawdown found a potential of 2.14 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas reductions in Scenario 1 over 2020–2050, corresponding to a 48 percent\xa0adoption of composting, with a net implementation savings of US$61 billion but a net operational cost of US$58 billion. The first cost of landfilling is almost double the cost of composting facilities; however, the operational cost of composting is 10 percent\xa0more than the cost of landfilling due to the maintenance incurred for aeration, moisture, and temperature control of compost piles. For Scenario 2, the emissions avoided amount to 3.1 gigatons with a 60 percent\xa0adoption', 'Discussion\nThe impact of composting is bounded by the amount of organic waste created. There are some indicators that as regions develop, the per capita amount of waste increases, then plateaus. All scenarios modeled are highly dependent on a significant increase in adoption in the Asia (sans Japan) region. Whereas less than 3 percent\xa0waste to landfills has already been achieved in several European countries, Project Drawdown has chosen more conservative growth scenarios for both China and Asia (sans Japan) to reflect the uncertainty of growth of composting, considering current investments in waste-to-energy facilities in the region.[11]\xa0 The financial case for adoption of composting is distorted by local regulations and compost demand.[12] Where regulations, space, and logistics create cost barriers to landfill expansion, there is already a self-evident business case for composting. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that composting can grow to offset a significant portion of landfilling, while reducing climate emissions. This is limited by the education required for composters and consumers, as well as the realization of a financial advantage that compost may have over landfilling.[13]\n\n\n\n[1] Using UN 2015 median urban population forecast', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

15,Concentrated Solar Power,"['Project Drawdown defines concentrated solar power as: an electricity generation technology that uses heat provided by direct normal solar irradiance concentrated on a small area, with and without storage. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Presently, there are four main concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies competing for the electricity market: 1) parabolic trough collectors (PTC); 2) parabolic dish collectors (PDC); 3) heliostat field collectors (Tower); and 4) linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR). Though PTC is the oldest and has the most widespread use, the newest (Tower) is the most likely to gain traction, since it is the most economically viable technology that also incorporates\xa0storage—an increasing requirement of\xa0CSP. This analysis models all CSP technologies, with and without storage', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[1]\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration. The total addressable market for concentrated solar power is based on projected global electricity generation in terawatt-hours from 2020 to 2050, with current adoption[2] estimated at only 0.06 percent of generation (13.7 percent)', 'CSP\xa0is particularly promising in regions with more than 2500 kilowatt-hours per meter squared per year of sunlight radiation, such as in the southwestern United States, Central and South America, Northern and Southern Africa, the Mediterranean countries of Europe, the Near and Middle East, Iran, and the desert plains of India, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, China, and Australia (ESTELA, 2016). This regional potential is accounted within the external sources projections', 'Adoption Scenarios[3]\nImpacts of increased adoption of concentrated solar from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario is based on the evaluation of yearly averages of five optimistic scenarios: IEA (2017) Energy Technology Perspectives 2DS and B2DS scenarios; IEA (2018) World Energy Outlook SDS; Advanced Scenario from the Greenpeace Solar Thermal Electricity Global Outlook 2016 (Greenpeace et al., 2016). It\xa0follows a medium growth trajectory', '\n\nScenario 2: The scenario projects a 100 percent\xa0adoption of non-fossil-fuel-based technologies in 2050. For this solution the adoption scenario follows a high growth trajectory derived from the above-mentioned model’s scenario results used in Scenario 1', '\nFinancial Model\nBased on a meta-analysis of the data collected of these systems around the world, the financial inputs used in the RRS model assume an average installation cost of US$6339 per kilowatt[4] with a learning rate of 20.3 percent, reducing the cost to US$1623 per kilowatt in 2030 and to US$962 in 2050. An average capacity factor of 31 percent is used for concentrated solar power, compared with\xa057 percent for conventional technologies such as coal, natural gas, and oil power plants. Variable operation and maintenance costs of US$0.046 per kilowatt-hour and fixed costs of US$63.7 per kilowatt are considered for CSP, compared with\xa0US$0.005 and US$43.7, respectively, for the conventional technologies', 'Integration[5]\nThrough the process of integrating CSP\xa0with other solutions, the total addressable markets were adjusted to account for reduced demand resulting from the growth of more energy-efficient technologies,[6] as well as increased electrification from other solutions such as\xa0electric cars\xa0 and high-speed rail. Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nComparing the results from the two modeled scenarios to the Reference Scenario allows us to estimate the climate and financial impacts of increased adoption of CSP. The results for Scenario 1 show that the net cost compared to the Reference Scenario would be US$474.3 billion from 2020 to 2050, with –US$886.4 billion in savings. Increasing the use of CSP\xa0from about 0.06 percent in 2018 to 7.3 percent of world electricity generation by 2050 would require an estimated US$1.7 trillion in cumulative first costs. With its low greenhouse gas emissions, under Scenario 1, CSP could reduce 18.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2050. Scenario 2 is more ambitious in the growth of CSP technologies, with impacts on greenhouse gas emission reductions over 2020–2050 of 24.0 gigatons carbon dioxide-equivalent', 'Discussion\nDespite still being in its infancy, CSP has significant potential for helping reverse global warming in an increasingly affordable way. However, the competition and growth of other more mature and less expensive renewable energy sources, such as onshore wind and solar photovoltaic, might delay the short-term adoption of CSP. The main advantages of CSP with storage is the possibility of providing firm and dispatchable power. Nevertheless, when compared with\xa0other solar technologies, CSP is heavily dependent on location\xa0due to the size of the projects and the irradiance radiation needed', 'New CSP capacity is projected to continue growing, but the\xa0pace is dependent on policy support schemes, either through stringent greenhouse gas mitigation policies or through financial and regulatory mechanisms for its adoption. Cost reductions will be driven by increasing economies of scale, more competitive supply chains, and technology improvements that will raise capacity factors and/or reduce installation costs', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand (TWh) supplied by the solution in 2018', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$', '\n\n[63\xa0For example: LED lighting and high efficiency heat pumps.']"
16,Conservation Agriculture,"['Project Drawdown defines conservation agriculture as: an annual crop production system that provides biosequestration via crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage. This solution replaces conventional annual cropping systems with tillage', 'The three components of conservation agriculture are: minimal soil disturbance (no-till or reduced tillage), permanent soil cover (cover crops), and diversified crop rotations. It is suited to both mechanized and unmechanized contexts. Climate mitigation from conservation agriculture is through reduced emissions from tillage and soil carbon sequestration', 'Methodology\nConservation agriculture is modeled as a bridge technology, which transitions to regenerative annual cropping over time. Converting from conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping only requires the addition of one more practice (compost application, organic farming, or green manure use). The soil health movement, the International Federation of Organic Movements’ “Organic 3.0”, and the many farmers working to implement organic no-till agriculture are all evidence that this transition is underway', 'Total Land Area[1]\nThe total land area allocated to conservation agriculture and regenerative annual cropping is the same: 685 million hectares of non-degraded croplands with minimal slopes, which is allocated differently under different custom adoption scenarios. In all scenarios, conservation agriculture grows until at least 2030 and then starts declining, but never shrinks below its 2018 rate of 148 million hectares', 'Adoption Scenarios[2]\nSix custom adoption scenarios were developed for conservation agriculture. All begin with current adoption[3] of 148 million hectares. Some scenarios use the current global adoption rate of 0.36 percent, while others use 1.24 percent, which is the rate from South America, the highest regional rate. The conservative scenarios assume adoption to continue through 2050, while the aggressive scenarios assume that the adoption of conservation agriculture will reach its peak by 2030 and begin to decline as land area under conservation agriculture converts to regenerative annual cropping. This conversion was assumed based on the increasing demand for organic and semi-organic agricultural products', 'Impacts of increased adoption of conservation agriculture from 2020-2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario was determined through analysis of the six custom adoption scenarios, in which the land area under conservation agriculture reaches to its peak (407 million hectares) by 2039 and then declines to 373 million hectares by 2050. The 34 million hectares lost from conservation agriculture are assumed to be converted to regenerative agriculture', 'Scenario 2: In this scenario, the land area under conservation agriculture reaches its peak (332 million hectares) by 2039 and then declines to 303 million hectares by 2050; the difference of 29 million hectares is added to regenerative annual cropping.\xa0\n\nUsually, the adoption area under any solution increases from the Plausible to Drawdown Scenario; however, this is not the case for conservation agriculture, due to its transition to regenerative annual cropping. Thus, a continuous decrease in conservation agriculture leads to a continuous increase in regenerative annual cropping from the Plausible to Drawdown Scenarios', 'Emissions, Sequestration, and Yield Model\nSequestration rates are set at 0.78, 0.38, 0.61, and 0.25 tons of carbon per hectare per year for tropical humid, temperate/boreal humid, tropical semi-arid, and temperate/boreal semi-arid zones, respectively. These are the result of meta-analysis of 59 data points from 40 sources. Emissions reduction rates from conservation agriculture are 0.23 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per hectare per year, based on meta-analysis of 14 data points from 7 sources', 'Yield gains compared to business as usual annual cropping were set at 6 percent, based on meta-analysis of 12 data points from 5 sources', 'Financial Model\nFinancial inputs for conservation agriculture were determined via meta-analysis. First costs are estimated at US$355.05[4] per hectare; for all agricultural solutions, it is assumed that there is no conventional first cost, as agriculture is already in place on the land. Net profit is US$650.65 per hectare per year, compared to US$407.47 for the conventional practice. Net profit is calculated at US$530.39 per hectare per year for the solution (based on meta-analysis of 19 data points from 6 sources), compared to US$474.21 per year for the conventional practice (based on 36 data points from 19 sources). While the operational cost is calculated at US$599.03 per hectare per year for the solution (based on 17 data points from 4 sources), compared to US$943.57 per year for the conventional practice (based on the 30 data points from 12 sources)', 'Integration[5]\nDrawdown’s Agro-Ecological Zone model allocates current and projected adoption of solutions to the planet’s forest, grassland, rainfed cropland, and irrigated cropland areas. Adoption of conservation agriculture was constrained by several factors. These include: limiting adoption to cropland of minimal slope, competition for said cropland with rice solutions, and a higher priority for regenerative annual cropping. The combined conservation agriculture/regenerative annual cropping practice is assigned third-level priority for non-degraded cropland of minimal slopes. Only rice-based solutions are more highly prioritized', 'Results\nTotal adoption in the Scenario 1 is 400 million hectares in 2050, representing 54 percent of the total available land. Of this, 224.64 million hectares are adopted from 2020-2050. The impact of this scenario is 13.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent sequestered by 2050. Net cost is US$91.9 billion. Lifetime savings in net profit is US$113.1 billion and operational cost is US$2.8 trillion. Yield reduction of 169 million metric tons is accounted between 2020 and 2050. Yield gains result in an additional yield of 1.5 billion metric tons of rice between 2020-2050', 'Total adoption in the Scenario 2 is 327 million hectares in 2050, representing 44 percent of the total available land. Of this, 155.40 million hectares are adopted from 2020-2050. The impact of this scenario is 9.43 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050.\xa0 Net cost is US$65.23 billion. Lifetime savings in net profit is US$77.7 billion and operational cost is US$1.9 trillion. Yield reduction of 169 million metric tons is accounted between 2020 and 2050. Yield gains result in an additional yield of 1.1 billion metric tons of rice between 2020-2050', 'Discussion\nBenchmarks\nDrawdown’s conservation agriculture mitigation impact is somewhat higher than Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) benchmarks, which estimate 0.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030 for cropland management, excluding rice and agroforestry (Smith, 2007). Griscom et al (2017)’s “Natural climate solutions” calculate 0.31-0.52 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030 for “cover cropping”, one of the six practice of regenerative annual cropping. The Drawdown model shows 0.3-0.5 gigatons carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030 for conservation agriculture and 0.5-0.7 for regenerative annual cropping, for a combined 0.86-0.98 gigatons carbon dioxide-equivalent per year in 2030', 'Limitations\nThis study was constrained by limited access to financial data at the farm, regional, and global levels. Future work should include collecting additional data on first costs and net profit per hectare', ""Conclusions\nConservation agriculture is already a potent global force for climate change mitigation. Drawdown's model builds on this success, and projects evolution and improvement in the practice (in the form of regenerative agriculture) to keep it a critical agricultural mitigation strategy into the future"", '\xa0\n\n\n[1] To learn more about the Total Land Area for the Food Sector, click the Sector Summary: Food link below', '\n\n[2] To learn more about Project Drawdown’s three growth scenarios, click the Scenarios link below.

17,Distributed Energy Storage,"['Project Drawdown defines Distributed energy storage as: decentralized energy storage systems generally based on battery storage. This solution replaces the conventional practice of obtaining all electricity from the centralized grid', 'Energy storage on the distributed scale is a powerful tool for enabling transformations in the energy system. Distributed energy storage systems can allow residential and commercial buildings to act as active participants in the electricity distribution system rather than passive consumers. They can allow consumers to draw power from the grid at times and rates of their choosing, avoiding steep charges for consumption at peak times or when demand spikes. When combined with distributed generation resources such as rooftop solar, distributed energy storage can open a path to energy independence for buildings. It can also ease adoption of variable, renewable energy sources on the utility scale by effecting a more predictable and responsive demand pattern. Finally, distributed energy storage is a crucial part of modernizing the energy system at large, through providing smart grid and related services', 'Presently, distributed energy storage is practiced only on a very small scale. The systems are generally based on battery storage, which has been prohibitively expensive for many years. Moreover, policy-based incentives for the use of distributed energy storage, such as time-of-use electricity pricing plans, have been lacking in many areas. The status quo has recently begun to shift, however, as batteries decrease sharply in price and utilities seek ways to avoid costly infrastructure upgrades in the face of rising demand. The increased penetration of distributed generation resources has also provided added incentive for consumers to consider the use of distributed energy storage. As such, distributed storage is at a tipping point and is poised to become a major element of the energy system', 'Methodology\nThis solution is key for the integration of variable renewable generation sources in the electricity grid. Without storage, these technologies face high curtailment rates; thus, storage is a crucial aspect of enabling a low-carbon grid. To avoid double-counting, the emissions impact of distributed energy storage \xa0is accounted for in the variable renewable electricity generation solutions such as wind and solar, and in the electric cars solution', 'Discussion\nDistributed energy storage is likely to become a major practice in the coming years and financially beneficial to consumers in the long term. It should have an important role to play in increasing the independence of energy consumers, and in helping to balance the load and supply “behind the meter” (i.e. in a building) with the capacity available on the grid. Distributed energy storage is also a key resource for ensuring the reliability of electrical energy services. As a result of these many benefits, it can be expected that adoption of distributed energy storage will increase greatly in the coming years, making it an important part of the changing energy landscape', 'However, due to inefficiencies in energy storage and high carbon dioxide emissions associated with the manufacturing of batteries, the use of distributed energy storage might not imply a reduction in emissions when considered in isolation. When vehicle-to-grid storage – connecting an electric vehicle to the grid to store electricity for later use – is considered alongside the increased integration of renewable energy sources for electricity generation, the impacts may prove more favorable. The emissions avoided from diesel and gasoline more than balance the emissions resulting from the manufacturing of batteries. As such, electric vehicles used as distributed energy storage can provide a significant climate benefit. Developing infrastructure and policy frameworks to promote adoption of vehicle-to-grid storage is therefore crucial as electric vehicle penetration increases']"
18,Distributed Solar Photovoltaics,"['Project Drawdown defines as distributed solar photovoltaic (PV), systems that typically are sited on rooftops, that include both residential solar PV and community-scale solar PV systems with under 1 megawatt of capacity. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'In a PV system, sunlight falling on a solar cell produces electricity as a result of the phenomenon of the photoelectric effect. The solar cells deployed in such systems are typically divided into three generations. The first-generation solar cells, which presently capture the majority of the\xa0 market, are based on crystalline silicon (Si) - either single crystalline or multi-crystalline. The second-generation solar cells are thin-film solar PV cells, which are again of three types, i.e.\xa0 a) amorphous\xa0 and micromorph silicon; b) cadmium telluride; and c) copper-indium-selenide and copper-indium-gallium-diselenide. Third-generation solar cells, such as high concentration PV cells, dye sensitized solar cells, and organic solar cells, are still under development and are not yet\xa0 fully commercialized', 'Most adoption scenarios of this technology earlier predicted only a low, single-digit percentage of total electricity to be generated by all SPV (including both rooftop as well as utility scale) by 2050; but in view of the rapid recent adoption of this technology in many countries,\xa0 the scenarios have also raised their levels of ambition. In fact some recent scenarios have even predicted that almost 60% of global electricity generation would come from solar PV by 2050. Such increased projections are largely based on increasing solar cell efficiencies and rapidly declining costs for PV systems, thus making them competitive with conventional generating sources in many parts of the world', 'Methodology\nTo capture the appropriate level of agency, the solar PV market was split between distributed solar photovoltaics (representing households and building owners) and utility-scale solar photovoltaics. This analysis models distributed solar PV systems with under 1 megawatt of capacity', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration.

With no definitive estimation of the type of future solar PV adoption, it is assumed that distributed PV installations represent around 40 percent of the market, with utility-scale solar capturing the remaining 60 percent (US DOE, 2012; IEA, 2014; SEIA, 2014)', 'Adoption Scenarios[3]\nImpacts of increased adoption of distributed solar PV from 2020-2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario is based on the evaluation of yearly averages of five optimistic scenarios: IEA (2017) Energy Technology Perspectives 2DS and B2DS scenarios; IEA (2018) World Energy Outlook SDS; IRENA (2018c) REmap Case scenario; and Grantham Institute and Carbon Tracker (2017) Strong PV Scenario using, a high growth trajectory', 'Scenario 2: This scenario is based on the yearly average values of three 100% RES scenarios of electricity generation by 2050, being Greenpeace (2015) Advanced Energy [R]evolution Scenario; Ram et al.

An average capacity factor of 19 percent is used for the solution, compared to 57 percent for conventional technologies. Fixed operation and maintenance costs of US$21.8 per kilowatt are considered for distributed solar photovoltaic systems, compared to US$34.7 per kilowatt for the conventional technologies', 'Integration[5]\nThrough the process of integrating distributed solar PV with other solutions, the total addressable markets were adjusted to account for reduced demand resulting from the growth of more energy-efficient technologies,[6] as well as increased electrification from other solutions like electric cars and high-speed rail.

Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nComparing the results from the two modeled scenarios to the Reference Scenario allows us to estimate the climate and financial impacts of increased adoption of distributed solar PV systems. The Scenario 1 projects 13.5 percent of total electricity generation worldwide from distributed solar PV by 2050 (i.e. 6,235 terawatt-hours). In the Scenario 2, the market share of this solution reaches 14.24 percent(i.e. 10,106 terawatt-hours) under a higher total addressable market', 'The climate and financial impacts for the accelerated adoption of distributed solar PV are both significant.

The Scenario 2 is more ambitious in the growth of distributed solar PV \xa0technologies, with impacts on greenhouse gas emission reductions over 2020-2050 of 68.64 gigatons associated with over US$13.5 trillion of lifetime savings', 'Discussion\nSolar has an incredibly promising long-term potential, as solar resources are plentiful and widespread and future advances in both battery and PV technologies should continue to drive the adoption of this technology, even in a world without specific policy interventions. Based on the financial impacts alone, it is clear that global adoption of rooftop solar is economically viable and will provide a significant return on investment. Rapid adoption will also contribute substantially to global greenhouse gas abatement', 'Nevertheless, the massive adoption of rooftop solar requires several issues to be contended with. It must be noted though that sunlight is intermittent, and electricity profiles from solar PV do not always match well with the typical demand profile of electricity consumers. This means that PV often must be installed alongside dispatchable sources such as coal and natural gas. Alternatively, solar PV can be installed with an energy storage system so that solar electricity generated during the day can be stored for use during the hours when the sun is not shining. Also, there will need to be more demand flexibility, to change the demand profile to better match the generation profile. There may also be materials constraints on the expansion of production capacity for current PV technology, for several critical materials are only mined as by-products of other metals and could be limited in their ability to meet the levels of production needed for significant global adoption.

19,District Heating,"['Project Drawdown defines district heating as\xa0a centralized renewably-powered heating system and the distribution of generated heat to the buildings of a defined community, through a network of insulated buried pipes, to satisfy the demand for space heating. District heating replaces the conventional practice of heating indoor spaces individually, with heat generated on-site. Combining heating loads into larger totals allows for the installation of more efficient boilers which are often only available or cost-effective in larger sizes. Powering renewable district heating systems is possible with biomass, solar, and geothermal energy as well as waste heat enabling economies of scope', 'District heating systems require a minimum heat load per linear unit of network to make them financially feasible and provide them an advantage over using on-site space heating systems. The density of the demand area and average yearly temperature dictate the heat load density in an area. In order for typical district heating (nonrenewable) to be commercially viable, there is a need for a minimum of 2 megawatt-hours per meter of planned network length. As a result, district heating systems have been implemented mainly in urban areas with higher population density, located at cooler climate zones (with mostly fossil-powered systems in Northern Europe, China, and Russia). District heating is a mature technology, with most systems currently using fossil fuels to generate heat', 'Methodology\nThis analysis focuses on the district heating systems that provide an alternative to conventional on-site heating by offering efficiencies through scale, replacing current systems’ fuel with renewable energy sources, and offering environmental benefits through decreased greenhouse gas emissions', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nThe total addressable market for district heating systems using renewable energy sources is based on estimated supply for commercial and residential building space-heating in terawatt-hours from 2020 to 2050, derived from International Energy Agency\xa0(IEA) data', 'Current adoption of district heating from renewable sources represents around 10 percent of total district heating systems (at least 150 terawatt-hours). Future adoption is focused on increasing the number of renewably-powered systems to meet demand, but also on using on-site heat exchangers instead of boilers and furnaces', 'Adoption Scenarios[2]\nThe impacts of increased adoption of district heating from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a Reference Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels.

Solution emissions (renewable district heating) were assumed 0. We exclude any indirect emissions from say, facility construction, due to limited availability of data and expected customized facilities for the localities of installation due to their unique availability of renewable energy sources. Emissions factors came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data', 'Financial Model\nThe financial inputs used in the model assume an average installation cost of US$1,796 per kilowatt,[3] determined through a variable meta-analysis (the conventional cost is US$198 per kilowatt).

These results for Scenario 1 show that savings would amount to US$1.6 trillion over the technology lifetime and 6.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalents over 2020–2050. Under Scenario 2, this solution could reduce 9.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from 2020 to 2050 and US$2.4 trillion for a net cost of US$337\xa0billion to get adoption to 20%', 'Discussion\nThe main advantages of district heating are twofold. First, the systems are highly flexible: it is much easier to impact ten buildings if they are on a common distribution loop than by trying to negotiate with each of the individual buildings to install efficient renewable technology at each of the buildings. Second, district heating employs economies of scale and economies of scope to install preferred technologies prior to achieving cost-effectiveness at the individual building scale', 'Limitations\nThe adoption path for district heating is influenced by different factors:\n\nhigh heat load density – because the heat network is capital-intensive, the heated area should have a high density to minimize the required pipe length\neconomic viability – the district heating system is economically viable only if the total heat requirement of the entire system exceeds a minimum level\nlocation of buildings – to minimize connection length, buildings should be within the minimum proximity of the existing heat network, resulting in lower investment and operational costs\nlocation of heat source – by locating the heat source close to or within the urban areas, the total length of heat network can be minimized', '\nIn some areas of the world (such as the United States and Europe), the existing drinking water and sewage infrastructure has reached the end of its lifetime. If replacing those piping networks can be coordinated with installing new district heating piping networks, the cost of the systems could be significantly reduced. In areas where new district heating systems can be installed at the same time as they are building new buildings, the cost of piping can in some cases be cut in half by utilizing radiant heating systems to distribute the heat inside the buildings, significantly decreasing first costs', 'Some of the first targets for conversion to renewable district heating systems should be fossil-based district heating systems, which are numerous in China and Russia. These systems, particularly those in China, are also often rather inefficient and result in significant emissions and local pollution. Converting these to renewables can have climate, financial, and health benefits for residents in those countries. Several other systems in Europe can also be upgraded to meet the low emissions standards of the leaders in Scandinavia', 'Note: August 2021 corrections appear in\xa0boldface', '\n\n[1] For more on the Total Addressable Market for the Buildings Sector, click the Sector Summary: Buildings link below', '\n\n[2] To learn more about Project Drawdown’s growth scenarios, click the Scenarios link below.

20,Dynamic Glass,"['Project Drawdown defines dynamic glass or smart glass as\xa0glass that dynamically changes its opacity to reduce or increase the amount of light and heat that is allowed to pass through. This technology replaces high-performance static glass that’s already prevalent in commercial buildings in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)', 'Dynamic glass promises energy savings for both thermal and lighting systems in buildings and transportation, though we focus only on architectural applications. Applications include sunlight regulation in buildings and glare reduction on rearview mirrors. There are many technologies that allow this, including those that automatically change in response to light, heat, or an electrical current (that is, by human control). Dynamic glass can greatly reduce the inefficiency of building windows and other glazed surfaces and can also eliminate the need for shading, resulting in an increase in natural lighting in buildings. In this report, we examine the potential financial and climate impact of increased adoption of dynamic glass instead of high-performance static glass for commercial building applications', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market (TAM) for dynamic glass was calculated using the Project Drawdown integrated buildings TAM model, which collectively calculates the TAMs of building floor area, roof area, space heating and cooling, and all other floor-area driven TAMs used in the building sector. The estimated areas are also subdivided by building type (residential and commercial), and by building climate zone[1]. This model used numerous sources. The total addressable market for commercial architectural glass was determined based on the estimated growth in commercial floor area from this model and the average commercial window-to-floor-area ratio from several sources. Recent sales data of dynamic glass from four market research sources was used to estimate the solution’s current adoption[2] in square meters of glass installed (2.48 million) and in square meters of commercial floor area adopted\xa0(42 million)', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of dynamic glass from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', ""For dynamic glass, scenarios were developed based on near-term projections and long-term targets from international organizations:\n\nScenario 1: For near-term forecasts to 2022, historical and trend data estimated by Navigant Research (2012) were\xa0used\xa0and interpolated with a far future forecast guided by the World\xa0Green Buildings Council's target of 100 percent net zero buildings by 2050.[3] A more conservative number of 30 percent adoption in 2050 was chosen"", '\n\nScenario 2: The same procedure was performed as in the Scenario 1, but 50 percent adoption in 2050 was used', '\nEmissions Model\nLighting, heating, and cooling energy data for commercial buildings were\xa0obtained from several sources and weighted by climate zone where possible. Energy efficiency of lighting, heating, and cooling were all found to be between 7 and 9 percent. Electricity and fuel consumption were included, and emissions factors were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs of dynamic glass are around three times those of conventional glass based on over 20 sources, but a learning rate of 8 percent was applied for dynamic glass.[4] As the technology is still relatively new, and as some types of dynamic glass do use small amounts of electricity whereas others do not, operating costs of the glass itself were not included. Cooling, heating, and lighting costs however, were included for commercial areas with dynamic glass adoption and those with conventional glass adoption', 'Integration\nThe dynamic glass solution was integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing all solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions like insulation were first, building systems like building automation systems\xa0were second, and building applications like heat pumps were last.[5] The impact on building energy demand was calculated for highest-priority solutions, and the dynamic glass input value was reduced to represent the impact of higher building envelope solutions. The output from the dynamic glass model was used as the input in lower-priority solutions', 'Results\nScenario 1 forecasts that just over 200 million square meters of dynamic glass could be installed by 2050, thereby avoiding 0.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions compared to high performance static glass. The marginal capital cost compared to the Reference Scenario would be US$69 billion, which assumes that conventional glass is purchased in the Reference Scenario,[6] but this scenario saves US$99 billion in operating costs over glass lifetimes due to reduced energy consumption', 'Scenario 2 of growth to 341 million square meters of glass shows 0.5 gigatons of emissions reduced and US$165 billion in lifetime savings at a cost of US$103 billion', 'Discussion\nIt is clear that dynamic glass can help commercial buildings reduce their emissions and save operating expenses, though the costs would be significant. For buildings going through a retrofit anyway, it could be financially viable to have dynamic windows installed instead of static high-performance windows. For buildings that do not need any other retrofit, the business case for retrofitting high-performance windows with dynamic windows (as opposed to staying with existing high-performance windows) may be weak. Some aspects that may affect this result have not been examined, however, such as the regional nature of adoption due to dynamic glass’s high price and weather application. Realistically, architectural dynamic glass will be mainly adopted in wealthier regions with higher average temperatures, such as Australia and the southern and western areas of the US. Additionally, there are likely some residential applications that would increase the impact of dynamic glass', 'The high up-front cost of dynamic glass has inhibited its growth. As new competitors enter the market (including for transportation applications of dynamic glass, which were not included in our model), the price of dynamic glass is expected to drop, and adoption is expected to accelerate. Growth could be further driven with government support and the development of programs that demonstrate the benefits of dynamic glass to consumers. It’s important to note, though, that for some areas and applications that still use plain glass (that is, non-high-performing), a large portion of the benefits of dynamic glass can be obtained with mature technologies that are considered high performance static that are mostly cheaper. This is examined in another model', '\n\n\n[1] We were guided by the ASHRAE 169 building climate zone standards', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018. This study uses 2014 as the base year', '\n\n[3] All buildings consume net zero energy / produce onsite or produce net zero carbon emissions', '\n\n[4] Although no learning rate data were\xa0found on dynamic glass, another cooling technology (air-conditioning units) had a learning rate of 13 percent, so a rate was used that was bounded by this', '\n\n[5] Although we used the term “priority,”\xa0we do not mean to say that any solution was of greater importance than any other, but rather that for estimating total impact of all building solutions, we simply applied the impacts of some solutions before others, and used the output energy demand after application of a higher-priority solution as the energy demand input to a lower-priority solution', '\n\n[6] All costs are presented in 2014 US$.']"
21,Efficient Aviation,"['Project Drawdown defines the efficient aviation solution as\xa0the increased use of technologies to reduce aircraft fuel burn. This solution replaces conventional aircraft with existing global fleet-wide fuel efficiency', 'In 2005, all of aviation’s share of global warming was 4.9 percent despite being only 2.2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in that year[1]. This is due to aviation’s generation of other climate pollutants besides carbon dioxide that also cause warming. Considering aviation fuel consumed in 2016[2], and all global carbon dioxide emissions in 2016[3], all aviation is estimated to have caused approximately 2.6 percent of manmade carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. Growth in aviation’s share is causing increasing alarm. Airplane fuel efficiency efforts aim to reduce fuel use per passenger-kilometer of air travel. Though freight-only aircraft fuel efficiency is not analyzed here, part of the impact on air freight fuel use is accounted for in the large fraction of total air freight that is carried in the belly of passenger aircraft.[4]\nThere are numerous technologies and operational approaches for reducing airplane fuel use; only the most impactful technologies in use today to improve fuel efficiency were included in this study. Therefore, well-publicized but noncommercial technologies such as aviation biofuels were excluded', 'Methodology\nThis analysis includes the newest, most fuel-efficient aircraft (called “intermediate generation”),[5] as well as the use of fuel efficiency retrofits to existing aircraft. Intermediate generation aircraft are expected to be 15–20 percent more fuel-efficient than earlier models, in part as a result of more fuel-efficient engines, new wingtip devices,[6] and light weighting approaches. Research suggests that the combination of these three technologies in a retrofit would amount to efficiency improvements comparable with\xa0a newer aircraft model. In this study, new and retrofitted aircraft are compared to conventional aircraft with the existing global fleetwide fuel efficiency', 'Total Addressable Market[7]\nThe total addressable market for efficient aviation is measured in terms of total interurban passenger travel by air, projected for every year of analysis (2020–2050), in billion passenger-kilometers. Current adoption[8] was taken as the total passenger-kilometers provided by existing intermediate generation aircraft, in the single-aisle and twin-aisle categories', 'Projected adoption of fuel-efficient aircraft was based on the expected production of intermediate generation aircraft, according to published delivery rates of major suppliers.[9] Delivery rates were assumed fixed for each aircraft type', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of efficient aviation from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the existing fraction of higher-efficiency aircraft remains constant', '\nScenario 1: Fuel burn is improved by 13 percent, Boeing and Airbus supply aircraft at their published rates, and an additional supplier starts adding comparably efficient aircraft to market[10]. One hundred aircraft are retrofitted annually', 'Scenario 2: Fuel burn is improved by 18 percent. Aircraft delivery rates, retrofitting, and retirement are similar to the Scenario 1. Global load factors increase to 83 percent\xa0(U.S.\xa0average)', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions for each scenario were estimated using the fuel emissions factor taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, and applied to fuel consumption data from the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT)', 'Financial Model\nCosts of adopting the intermediate generation aircraft are reported as the additional cost compared to adopting aircraft with average fleet efficiency. For each intermediate generation aircraft, an equivalent conventional aircraft was priced and the price difference was derived.[11] The average difference for single-aisle aircraft was around US$11 million,[12] and that of twin-aisle was US$40 million.[13] Operating costs, which included fuel costs, were derived using historical data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).[14] The solution’s operating costs were reduced by the efficiency improvements noted above', 'Integration\nTo prevent double-counting, steps were taken to ensure that the total travel demand of all non-urban passenger Transport Sector solutions remained below the projected total non-urban travel demand', 'Results\nIn Scenario 1, a potential reduction of 6.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas was found from 2020 to 2050, which corresponds to an 80 percent adoption rate by 2050. Net costs over that time would be US$863\xa0billion above the conventional approach. Efficiency improvements are estimated to bring lifetime operating savings of US$2.5 trillion[15], however. For the Scenario 2, the emissions avoided amounted to 9.2 gigatons with 85 percent adoption', 'Discussion\nThe use of more efficient aircraft is desirable for airlines in times of higher fuel prices. It would have direct bottom-line impacts, as fuel often represents a third of operating costs. Since 2015, however, fuel prices have been relatively low, and there is no assurance that prices will return to their previous levels of almost three times higher. At these lower fuel prices, the financial attractiveness of these aircraft efficiency improvements is not great, and in some cases result in negative net present values for airlines according to our calculations. However some of this may change with the coming implementation of the \xa0Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) program. To some extent, inclusion of fuel switching approaches such as aviation biofuels can help reduce the need for aircraft technology improvements', 'Limitations\nThere are limitations to this approach. For example, the potential of other technologies being implemented was excluded in this study.[16] Also, the Reference Scenario conservatively assumes fixed fleet efficiency. These limiting assumptions were made to show the impact of existing technologies on the airline industry.

22,Efficient Ocean Shipping,"['Project Drawdown defines the efficient ocean shipping solution as\xa0the use of technologies to make maritime shipping less fuel-intensive. This solution replaces conventional maritime shipping practices and technologies', 'Shipping is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from shipping for 2012 are estimated at 972 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent gases[1]. These emissions are forecasted to increase by 50–250 percent over the next 33 years, representing 10–14 percent of global emissions by 2050. Emissions from shipping are a function of\xa0the demand for transportation, the efficiency of ships, operational conditions at sea, fuel used, and more. Many emissions reduction techniques are available, including technical improvements, operational measures, and fuel replacement. In addition to the practice of “slow steaming,”[2] this solution considers a suite of 17 energy-efficient technologies based on the Global Maritime Energy Efficiency Partnership (GloMEEP) project by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[3]\nThe total addressable market for efficient ocean shipping is defined as the total demand for maritime freight work projected to 2050 by the IMO and others. The model uses various projections of the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI), which are derived from forecasts of different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and transport work done by ships in the future. An efficient ship is assumed to be 50 percent more efficient than a conventional ship, based on a combination of different efficiency measures and the practice of slow steaming.[4]\nCurrent adoption[5] of efficient ocean shipping is estimated as 5 percent of the total addressable market. This was calculated by taking the improvement in EEOI in 2018 compared with\xa02014, the base year.[6]\nAdoption Scenarios[7]\nFuture adoption of efficient ocean shipping was estimated using EEOI projections to 2050 made in the Third Greenhouse Gas Study of the IMO.

Scenario 2 shows an avoidance of 6.3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions and US$876 billion in lifetime savings', 'Discussion\nLarge capital investments are required to capture the benefits estimated above, and these may be difficult to finance due to split incentives[11] and difficulties in verifying fuel savings. However, some of these investments can be recovered quickly, leading to lifetime cost savings. We included some technologies that were not yet cost-effective. If these were removed, the profitability of efficient ships would increase, but at the expense of lower emissions impacts. A more granular analysis with faster learning rates of up to 15 percent for some technologies could prove insightful. While there are cost and emissions savings in each Scenario 2, the cost of freight transportation may increase in the short term, which may result in a marginal increase in the prices of commodities', 'Although a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from efficient ocean shipping is forecast\xa0over time, the rate of these reductions has to be increased so that the aggregate emissions from international shipping can be controlled. The IMO has put into place rules concerning sulfur in ships which are effective from 2020, but no defined plan for carbon emissions has yet been agreed despite the low-sulfur rules possibly having a carbon emissions impact when fuel switching to say, LNG or biofuel occurs. Voluntary adoption of energy-efficiency measures for ships has been observed in the case of certain shipping companies because\xa0it leads to direct lowering of operational costs for ships.

Global grid emissions factors are applied for e-bicycle electricity emissions. The conventional alternative was developed as a combination of modes of transport (e.g., car, bus). Some of these modes use electricity, while most use fuel. After weighting the energy usage, grid and fuel emissions were calculated per billion passenger-kilometers of travel for each alternative (e-bicycle and conventional transportation) to compare the two', 'Financial Model\nInstallation costs are taken from a wide range of sources. The e-bicycle data suggest\xa0that the battery is the major component of costs, and battery size varies across bicycles. The purchase of e-bicycles was therefore priced based on the battery, measured in Watt-hours of battery capacity. The average of 19 data points was used: US$327,000 per Megawatt-hour of battery capacity.[6] A learning rate of 6 percent was applied, based on estimates ranging from 6 to 9 percent for battery cost reduction due to rapid research in battery technology (applicable to cars, mobile phones, and other mobile devices). The lifetime of batteries was estimated to be\xa0two to six\xa0years, depending on type. Our calculations indicate that lead-acid batteries may last around two\xa0years, whereas lithium-ion batteries have a life span of around six years. Battery replacement, therefore, is included in these first costs', 'Operating costs were taken as the cost of grid electricity, assuming that e-bike users use on average 12 Watt-hours per kilometer of travel.[7] All variables were weighted by the market share (modeshare) of these alternatives', 'Integration[8]\nSince e-bikes are considered a high priority in the set of urban transport solutions, integration effects were not of major concern. Thus, the full projected adoption for each e-bike scenario was applied.[9] Variables shared across this and other solutions had the same inputs', 'Results\nGiven the projections described in Scenario 1, e-bikes could prevent the release of 1,300 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases and save consumers US$610 billion in lifetime operating costs over 2020–2050.[10] The first costs are also lower by US$304\xa0billion because\xa0e-bikes are cheaper than the conventional alternative (cars), even when battery replacements costs are included. Scenario 2 avoids 4.1 gigatons of emissions', 'Discussion\nThe ITDP/UCD study found that combined cycling (regular and e-bicycles) could save US$24 trillion between 2015 and 2050\xa0and avoid 225 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2050. The total bicycle and e-bicycle impact in Scenario 1 is 172 million tons of emissions reductions in 2050, with total construction savings of US$3 trillion from 2020 to 2050. These results are much more conservative, in part because we do not include car fuel, vehicle purchase and maintenance cost savings, and some other knock-on savings for the bicycle infrastructure solution.[11] Total bicycle and e-bicycle impact in Scenario 2 is higher, at 493 million tons of emissions reductions in 2050, suggesting that the ITDP/UCD adoption probably lies between our Plausible and Scenario 2s', 'As e-bike batteries become less expensive and more energy-dense, the benefits from e-bicycles will grow. However, a large increase in the use of lithium-ion batteries will necessitate large-scale production and battery recycling methods that are not yet commercially or practically viable. Nevertheless, there is great opportunity in the use of e-bicycles to get urban travelers out of their cars and avoid billions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions', 'Note: August 2021 corrections appear in\xa0boldface', '\n\n\n[1] Most e-bikes in China have lead-acid batteries, whereas the higher-end batteries are lithium-ion', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

25,Electric Cars,"['Project Drawdown defines electric cars (electric vehicles, EVs) as\xa0the increased use of battery and plug-in hybrid cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and light trucks. This solution replaces the use of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars', 'Most light-duty vehicles in use today rely on liquid fuel for energy storage and propulsion in an internal combustion engine. Electric vehicles (EVs) use a more energy-efficient electric motor\xa0and have high-capacity batteries on board that can be charged from the electric grid.[1] The EV market is still in its infancy, with early adopters driving the high growth seen over the past 10\xa0years. Even though EVs are still only a small fraction of vehicle sales and stock, they are expected to grow dramatically over the coming decades, replacing a large share of conventional vehicles and causing a dent in the carbon dioxide emissions from road transportation. For purposes of this work, both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs are included in specified shares. All relevant variables are weighted according to this share', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[2]\nThe total addressable market for electric cars represents the total number of urban and non-urban passenger-kilometers projected by sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) to 2050. Current adoption[3] of EVs is taken as 0.47 percent of all passenger cars in the global fleet or 0.18 percent of the total global mobility in passenger-kilometers, based on several sources. The total passenger-kilometers of light-duty vehicles was averaged from data provided by the IEA, ICCT, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), and University of California, Davis (UCD)', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nImpacts of increased adoption of electric cars from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. They\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: Adoption is aligned with the IEA projection for EV stock.[5]\xa0All EV passenger-kilometers are assumed to be urban-only until 2020, after which the nonurban share increases by 5 percent annually until 2026. From 2026 on, the share of urban EV passenger-kilometers remains at 70 percent.[6]\nScenario 2: IEA projections[7] and historical EV sales[8] are combined to project the total stock of EV cars out to 2050. The urban share of all EV mobility drops from 2021 by 5 percent\xa0per year until 2030 representing more extensive support for nonurban driving and reduced range anxiety', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions estimates are based on the electricity and fuel usage data from a range of sources, with emissions factors calculated based on the guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and recent sources for grid emissions factors. Indirect emissions were also included. EV production generates 6 percent higher indirect emissions than ICE vehicles', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs for purchasing an EV or ICE vehicle were estimated using recent data from several sources that cover key markets like the US, China, EU and Japan as well as the world as a whole. Costs were weighted by market sales. Purchase costs for the EV were averaged to be US$8,000 (31 percent) higher than the ICE vehicle.[9]\nOperating costs included grid electricity for the EV (dependent on the ratio of battery to plug-in hybrid EVs in each scenario), and fuel (for the plug-in hybrid and ICE). Electricity and fuel use were based on several sources including US EIA[10] data. The weighted global average fuel prices were derived from recent IEA estimates, and electricity prices were calculated using data from 51 countries over 10 years. Additionally, operating costs included the maintenance costs for cars and fixed operating costs.[11]\nIntegration[12]\nTo enable integration and minimize double counting, some inputs were harmonized across solutions for consistency.[13] The additional demand on the electricity grid resulting from the growth of EV usage was accounted for in the integrated total market for electricity. To avoid double-counting emissions benefits, the results presented for EVs do not reflect the increasingly cleaner grid; instead, these additional emissions benefits are accounted for directly in the supply-side energy solutions. Additionally, as EVs were integrated with the Carpooling solution, increased occupancy of EVs and ICEs was assumed over time as the Carpooling solution adoption increased. This changed the energy consumption variables', 'Results\nEV adoption in the Scenario 1 leads to 858 million EVs on the roads in 2050, compared to only 5.2 million EVs in 2018. This rapid growth in the EV fleet results in the reduction of 11.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2050, and US$15.3 trillion[14] in lifetime operating savings.[15] The purchase cost is, however, $4.7\xa0trillion. The Scenario 2 projects that 1.2 billion EVs would join the global fleet by 2050, resulting in 15.7 gigatons of emissions avoided', 'Discussion\nEV adoption is beneficial for the climate, and our financial analysis shows that it will also save operating costs for households, although at a higher purchase cost in Scenario 1. For the other scenario, the operating savings are higher. Consumer education is a key component of EV adoption, in order to relieve concerns about the upfront price premium and the reduced range of EVs compared with\xa0ICE cars. As battery technology matures and economies of scale grow, the price of manufacturing high-capacity batteries will decrease, so both the purchase price and range of EVs will become more attractive to consumers. However to get to that point may require greater financial incentives for consumers as well as a focus on the mass market rather than the high-end consumer. Some potential problems from increased battery production would have to be managed. For example, sourcing of key metals such as cobalt, copper, and nickel, whose supply chains can have negative environmental and social impacts around the world. Additionally, the disposal of old batteries is an environmental challenge at this point. These issues should be managed alongside the growth of the EV market', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] The grid in general is much less polluting than conventional vehicles, and is growing cleaner annually around the world', '\n\n[2] For more on the Total Addressable Market for the Transport Sector, click the Sector Summary: Transport link below', '\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

26,Electric Trains,"['Project Drawdown defines the electric trains solution as\xa0the increased electrification of freight railways. This solution replaces the conventional use of diesel-powered freight trains', 'Railways are already efficient modes of transportation, whether for goods or passengers. Historically, they have been the backbone of the transport networks for many countries, and remain a critical part of goods transport worldwide. Due to their nature, railways are limited in destinations and flexibility, but they tend to be very low cost to operate and are often used for transportation of lower-value goods such as coal, oil, and bulk materials', 'Freight railways can be made more efficient by a wide variety of approaches, including: lighter trains, which need less energy to move; better braking, often with software that supports the train pilot; and electrification of the traction power. The last alternative allows for lower amounts of energy usage at the point of consumption (onboard the train) since the train doesn’t have to carry the diesel fuel long distances before use. Railway electrification stands at about 37 percent of the global track length in 2018 (based on International Railway Union [UIC][1] data); this percentage has been growing over the last two decades by amounts that vary widely from year to year.[2] Electrification costs are high, since electrical power has to be supplied all along the length of the tracks so that trains always have access to power, very often through overhead cables. However, once electrified, running costs are very low, so for high demand routes, electrification can be very attractive financially. Electrification is promoted by global bodies as a way to reduce operating costs an emissions, so a continuation of electrification growth can be expected', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[3]\nThe total addressable market for electric trains is defined as the total number of ton-kilometers of rail freight demand projected to 2050. This analysis compares the financial and climate impacts of electrified freight rail transport to regular tracks needing diesel-powered trains.

A linear growth was assumed to interpolate annual adoption from 2014 to 2050. The average annual use of electrified tracks also increases by 25 percent, to represent intensified usage of electrified tracks due to the high first costs and very low operating costs', '\nEmissions Model\nAvoided emissions are based on the reduction in fuel use from replacing conventional trains, as well as on additional grid emissions from electrification', 'Financial Model\nEstimates of electrification costs per kilometer were used for the solution, and 0 for the conventional first costs. This assumes that the electrification of existing tracks costs about as much as the increase in cost between laying new non-electrified tracks and laying new electrified tracks. Operating costs for non-electrified and electrified freight were obtained from 5 sources, including the International Transport Forum, the International Energy Agency, and the UIC', 'Integration[8]\nThe additional demand on the electricity grid resulting from the growth of electrified track usage was accounted for in the integrated total market for electricity.

Unit costs are lower on high usage corridors, however, so these should be the initial targets for electrification. Additionally, we did not include the use of passenger rail services on electrified tracks (i.e., shared-use corridors), nor other efficiency technologies such as lighter trains and better train control technology, which may provide additional financial benefits or challenges.

29,Geothermal Power,"['Project Drawdown defines geothermal power as: geothermal systems for electricity generation, combining both mature technologies and future expectations for enhanced geothermal. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'There are three main geothermal technologies: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle power plants. Flash plants are the most common type of geothermal, and make up around 70 percent of total global installed geothermal capacity. Binary plants are the most recently developed geothermal technology, and are able to tap into lower temperature reservoirs (at much higher costs) than flash plants. The selection of which technology to use for geothermal power generation depends on a number of factors, including the characterization of the geothermal resource, and the economic feasibility of the project', 'Geothermal energy has the potential to make a much more significant contribution on the global scale through the development of enhanced or engineered geothermal systems, particularly those exploiting “hot rock.” Given the costs and limited full-scale system research to date, enhanced geothermal systems remains in their infancy, with only\xa0research and pilot projects existing around the world and no commercial-scale plants available to date', 'Methodology\nThis analysis models geothermal systems for electricity generation, combining both mature technologies and future expectations for enhanced geothermal systems adoption', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration. The total addressable market for geothermal power \xa0is based on projected global electricity generation in terawatt-hours from 2020-2050, with current adoption[2] estimated at 0.34 percent of generation (i.e. 90 terawatt-hours)', 'Adoption Scenarios[3]\nImpacts of increased adoption of geothermal power from 2020-2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: this scenario is derived from\xa0 the yearly average estimated adoption of IEA (2017) Energy Technology Perspectives 2DS and B2DS scenarios; IEA (2018) World Energy Outlook SDS; and Grantham Institute and Carbon Tracker (2017) NDC policy levels and original technology costs scenario, using a medium growth trajectory', 'Scenario 2: This scenario follows a high growth using the same scenarios considered for the Scenario 1', '\nFinancial Model\nBased on a meta-analysis of the data collected of these systems installation costs around the world, the financial inputs used in the model consider an average installation cost for the combination of different types of geothermal plants of US$4,491 per kilowatt.[4] It is acknowledged that the experimental nature of enhanced geothermal systems technology makes it difficult to evaluate the costs of a commercial-scale enhanced geothermal systems power plant. An average learning rate of 10 percent was used, trying to capture both the future costs for mature technologies such as flash and binary—which could see reduced installation costs in the near future—and the uncertainties in the development of enhanced geothermal systems. In 2030, the investment costs are reduced to US$3,057 per kilowatt, and to close to US$2,475 per kilowatt in 2050. An average capacity factor of 86 percent was used for geothermal systems for electricity generation, compared to 57 percent for conventional technologies such as coal, natural gas, and oil power plants. Variable operation and maintenance costs of US$0.017 per kilowatt-hour and of US$154.3 per kilowatt for fixed costs are considered for geothermal systems, compared to US$0.005 and US$34.7, respectively, for the conventional technologies. When fuel costs are considered, geothermal plants are shown to have significantly lower operational and maintenance costs than coal and natural gas plants', 'Integration[5]\nThrough the process of integrating geothermal power with other solutions, the total addressable markets were adjusted to account for reduced demand resulting from the growth of more energy-efficient technologies,[6] as well as increased electrification from other solutions like electric cars \xa0and high-speed rail. Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nCompared to the Reference Scenario, the financial results for the Scenario 1 of adoption show that the marginal first costs projected are US$80.6 billion from 2020-50, with over US$810 billions in savings over the lifetime of the technologies. Under the Scenario 1, the adoption of geothermal technologies for electricity generation could avoid 6.19 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from 2020-2050, compared to a Reference Scenario where the solution share in the total addressable market remains similar to the current values', 'The Scenario 2 is more ambitious in the growth of these technologies, with impacts on greenhouse gas emission reductions over 2020-2050 of 9.85 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent. Geothermal could act as a form of baseload power and peaking power, helping to support the increased grid integration of other forms of renewable electricity to further bring down emissions', 'Discussion\nThere exists a vast and untapped technical potential for geothermal energy. Much of the initial development could take place in areas with lots of conventional, high-temperature hydrothermal resources that have yet to be developed, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Central and South America, and East Africa', 'Large upfront costs\xa0 and the high risk of investing in geothermal power plants are two of the biggest barriers to the expansion of geothermal electricity. Drilling rig rates and associated costs often make up the largest cost component of geothermal plants, and there is a significantly high chance of failure in exploratory stages. Thus, many governments are setting targets for the development of high-temperature hydrothermal resources. These goals could be aided through: renewable portfolio standards requiring a certain amount of renewable energy use; a price on carbon; and guaranteed power purchase agreements or feed-in tariffs for developers to reliably recover development costs. A publicly accessible and continuously updated database of geothermal resources could also aid in exploration and cut down on production costs.

30,Grassland Protection,"['Project Drawdown defines grassland protection as: the legal protection of natural, ungrazed grasslands from future grazing and/or conversion to annual cropland, perennial cropland, biomass or bioenergy crops. Protection leads to reduced land use change and the safeguarding of carbon sinks. This solution replaces unprotected grassland. It is assumed that grassland protection primarily happens at the government and non-governmental organization (NGO) level. Grasslands here includes rangeland, shrubland, and savanna. Grasslands hold 20% of global carbon stocks. Tropical savanna and grassland carbon stocks total 326 Gt CO2-eq, while temperate grasslands and shrublands store 199 Gt C02-eq. Grasslands are also important storehouses of biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. Conversion of grasslands to other uses causes emissions of stored carbon', 'Grasslands are heavily used for agriculture and are at high risk of future land use change and emissions from loss of carbon stocks. Between 20-25% of grasslands have already been converted to cropland, while 75% of the remaining grasslands are grazed, leaving 590-1,040 Mha of ungrazed grasslands, though this includes some wetland as well. Grassland are particularly targeted for afforestation and cropland conversion at present. For example scenarios with high adoption of Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage rely on large-scale land use change of grasslands, as do business-as-usual food supply scenarios', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area[1]\nThe total land area available for the grassland protection solution was set to 500 million hectares on non-degraded grasslands.[2] Current adoption[3] of grassland protection is 159 million hectares', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nFour custom adoption scenarios were developed for grassland protection based on the protection commitment made for the temperate grassland and based on historical data available on protected grassland area globally in the temperate in the year 1996 and 2009.

31,Green and Cool Roofs,"['Project Drawdown defines cool roofs as building roofs that use light reflecting materials or paints. We also define green roofs as\xa0building roofs with natural vegetation. This replaces the conventional practice of building traditional, dark-colored roofs not covered with vegetation', 'Green roofs impact global warming by providing an insulating layer of vegetation on top of residences and commercial properties that reduces the energy load and emissions related to heating and cooling buildings, lowers the ambient air temperature to make HVAC systems more effective and captures or slows water runoff. Cool roofs reflect more incoming sunlight than traditional darker roofs, which in turn reduces the heat of the roof surface and the cooling load of a building. By reducing overall energy load and lowering the surrounding air temperature, cool roofs effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions related to air conditioning', 'Methodology\nTo model the adoption of cool roofs and green roofs, two models were created—one for green roofs and one for cool roofs—and the results were added together. Both models share the same functional unit, square meter of roof, which also doubles as the unit of implementation', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nThe total addressable markets (TAM) for cool roofs and green roofs were calculated for each type of roof solution. These are based on the Project Drawdown integrated buildings TAM model which collectively calculates the TAMs of building floor area, roof area, space heating and cooling, and all other floor-area driven TAM’s used in the building sector. The estimated areas are also subdivided by building type (residential and commercial), and by building climate zone[2]. This model used numerous sources. From a total possible global roof area estimate, we apply two\xa0filters. First, we assume a specified percent of the total roof area in each climate zone is appropriate for each roof type, and for cool roofs, this varies from 0 percent in “cold”\xa0and “arctic”\xa0climate zones 7 and 8 to 100 percent in “extremely hot”\xa0climate zone 0. Secondly, we apply a filter to represent the appropriateness of roofs in the filtered zones to have the specified solution. For instance, due to soil weight, green roofs require structural support and minimal slopes, so we assumed that only 15 percent\xa0of existing buildings fulfil these criteria, but 50 percent\xa0of new buildings can fulfil it (with sufficient global action to promote green roofs). The global market for green roofs in 2018 was 17 billion square meters of roof area, growing to 45 billion by 2050. The global market for cool roofs in 2018 was 95 billion square meters of roof area, growing to 146 billion by 2050', 'Current adoption[3] of each roof type was estimated for 2018. Green roofs were estimated at current adoption of 1 percent, and cool roofs were estimated at 5 percent. This current adoption was used to calculate the Reference Scenario from 2020 to 2050. In the Reference Scenario, any roof that is not adopted as a green or cool roof is assumed to be a conventional asphalt shingle roof', 'For forecasting adoption of green roofs, a default sigmoid curve was used to grow adoption as a percentage of the market to the year 2050. Percentage targets were used and are justified by current adoption trend characteristics, current policy and incentive trends, and likely barriers to adoption (first cost and operating cost considerations). With adoption scenarios established, key financial and climate variables were applied to the roof area adopted to determine greenhouse gas mitigation potential and cost/savings results for cool roofs and green roofs', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nImpacts of increased adoption of green roofs from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: Cool roofs were assumed to grow at a 7 percent equivalent rate annually following an s-curve, which would indicate a 30 percent adoption in 2050. Green roofs were assumed to grow at a 9 percent equivalent rate annually following an s-curve, which would indicate a 9 percent adoption in 2050', 'Scenario 2: Cool roofs were assumed to grow at a 9 percent equivalent rate annually following an s-curve, which would indicate a 48 percent adoption in 2050. Green roofs were assumed to grow at an 11 percent equivalent rate annually following an s-curve, which would indicate a 13 percent adoption in 2050', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions included in this analysis are electricity and fuel for cooling and heating (including a heating penalty for cool roofs). These variables use data from a range of sources in the peer-reviewed literature, and most of them were weighted by climate zone. Emissions factors were obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines', 'Financial Model\nFinancial variables were statistically assessed by comparing multiple sources of both first cost (cost of solution acquisition and implementation) and full operating cost (maintenance of the roof, and the energy load costs of the building associated with the roof type). A conventional operating cost was constructed, and the reduction data was applied to that conventional operating cost value. For green roofs, a particular benefit is managing storm water which is easier and cheaper with green roofs. For this reason, storm water related costs have been included in this model', 'Integration[5]\nDrawdown’s roofs solutions were integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing all solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions like Insulation were first, building systems like BAS were second, and building applications like Heat Pumps were last. Thus, the cool roofs and green roofs energy saving potential was reduced to represent the prior energy savings of the higher-priority solution: Insulation', 'Results\nDrawdown found a potential for 0.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas reductions in the Scenario 1 over 2020–2050, with a net implementation cost of US$624 billion and lifetime operational savings of US$330 billion.[6] For Scenario 2, the emissions avoided amount to 1.1 gigatons, the lifetime savings, $593 billion, and the net cost, $954\xa0billion. However, most of the cost ($815\xa0billion in Scenario 2) comes from the green roof solution, yet most of the emissions reduction and operational savings (1 gigaton and $735 billion, respectively, in Scenario 2) come from the cool roofs solution', 'Discussion\nGreen roofs show promise in the appropriate climate conditions to have significant emissions mitigation impact, but the likely driver of adoption will be their impact on urban stormwater retention and wildlife habitats supported by urban policies. While we have included mostly costs for extensive\xa0 green roofs which are characterized by under 15 cm of soil cover and only grasses, intensive green roofs are far more expensive as they require even stronger roofs to support more soil, more captured water and larger plants. The additional aesthetic and social benefits have not been captured, but they can be significant in urban environments', 'Cool roofs are an excellent tool to assist with the localized urban heat island effect and impact energy savings. There are numerous methods of implementation including special roof tiles and paints, and it could be a low cost option to improve building temperatures in some hot developing regions. However, it is clear that there needs to be a more nuanced approach to implementation, particularly with local climatic conditions, as there can be a net negative effect with implementation making a heating penalty a reality. Cooling in the warmer seasons is good, but cooling in the cooler seasons is not, and cool roofs are unchangeable across seasons in temperate regions', 'Many researchers have modeled and/or reported on the potential impact of increased albedo through cool roofs on global temperatures. The results of some of these models show significant global cooling. However, other studies assert that cool roofs which increase urban surface albedo are limited in their potential.[7]\xa0 The significant difference in results has prompted at least two papers which assess the methodologies involved and discuss the different approaches, assumptions, and limitations.[8] Differences in models and how they account for oceans, aerosols, moisture balance, cloud formation, and spatial resolution account for the controversy. Here, the conservative approach has been taken and potential global cooling because of increased urban albedo has been discounted for all Scenario 2s. It should be noted that researchers agree that cool roofs have an effect of reducing overall building energy use, which is the mitigation effect modeled in all Scenario 2s', 'Note: August 2021 corrections appear in\xa0boldface', '\n\n[1] For more on the Total Addressable Market for the Buildings Sector, click the Sector Summary: Buildings link below', '\n\n[2] We were guided by the ASHRAE 169 building climate zone standards\n\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

32,Grid Flexibility,"['Project Drawdown defines grid flexibility as\xa0a portfolio of practices and technologies (system operation, markets, load, flexible generation, networks, and storage) that increase grid efficiency, resilience, and ability to integrate variable renewable energy sources. The practices and technologies that constitute grid flexibility are in varying states of maturity: each one contains both elements that have existed since the beginning of electrification—such as governors on generators to keep frequency steady as load varies—and cutting-edge innovation just commercialized or on the horizon (e.g. advanced batteries, software platforms to enable dynamic trading of energy services)', 'Every electric power system has some degree of flexibility built in to provide a buffer between supply and demand. Adding variable renewable energy to a system increases the need for flexibility; fortunately, many means of providing it are inexpensive or have collateral benefits that offset their cost', 'Methodology\nAdoption of grid flexibility is driven by\xa0incorporation of variable renewable energy into the electric grid; the age of existing infrastructure and its ability to manage two-way power flows (i.e., from a utility to a household and back); and the need to make the grid more resilient in the face of increasing natural disasters. In general, the practices and technologies that make the grid more flexible are challenging to quantify in a meaningful way, since there are many intertwined factors contributing to a more flexible grid. Metrics for this quantification are being developed (e.g., Cochran et al., 2014), though this solution has not been modeled', 'Discussion\nFlexibility tools that rely on changes in law, changes in behavior, and changes in standards only reduce\xa0carbon dioxide emissions insofar as they\xa0increase the penetration of variable renewable energy sources of electricity generation', 'Barriers to adoption of grid flexibility include\xa0public objection to new infrastructure such as transmission lines; reluctance on the part of regulated utilities to share data about system needs with unregulated competitors; privacy issues with regard to two-way communications between households and utilities; and the slow pace of changing regulations, as regulators face the challenge of encouraging innovation that benefits the system while protecting the interests of all rate payers', 'Three trends stand out that will accelerate adoption of grid flexibility. The first relates to the availability, communication, and processing of data. As information technology has become more and more accessible, available, and cost effective, it has begun to transform the way that electricity is metered, billed, and valued, and made way for a host of new data-based services. Information and communication technologies provide utilities and energy providers with new opportunities to optimize energy systems management, which in turn enables new business models that promote investment in variable renewable energy sources and the infrastructure to integrate them. What began as an investment in automated meter reading in the 1990s has evolved into advanced metering infrastructure, which is expanding to include the exchange of many kinds of grid data over multiple communication networks (radio, cell, fiber, and conductor)', 'The second trend relates to energy storage and is discussed in detail in the utility scale energy storage and distributed energy storage solutions. The acceleration in advancement of lithium-ion batteries beginning around 2010 and their recent rapid decline in cost have made them increasingly useful and cost-effective', 'The third trend, closely related to the second, is the uptake in adoption of electric cars. Wherever infrastructure allows electric vehicles to support the grid with energy and ancillary services (i.e., through smart charging and vehicle-to-grid systems), the grid will become more flexible. If battery costs remain high, then once past their useful life in cars they will be available for a second life in buildings. If battery costs fall enough to make battery second-life use impractical, then energy storage will have become cheap enough to be widely deployed and support a high penetration of variable renewable energy sources', 'Better, more detailed and comprehensive methods of quantifying costs and benefits of the various practices and technologies would enable policymakers, regulators, and market operators to craft optimized solutions for integrating variable renewable energy sources into the grid.']"
33,Health and Education,"['Population growth is a direct function of fertility, mortality, and migration. Slowing the momentum of human population growth in a way that upholds human rights is an important factor in slowing carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions. By filling the expressed unmet need for family planning through voluntary family planning interventions, unintended pregnancies and consequently unintended births will be averted, thereby reducing the total estimated future population growth and consequently avoiding global greenhouse emissions through lower demand of goods and services. Voluntary family planning is the practice of controlling the timing, spacing, and number of children in a family to limit the number of unintended pregnancies. \xa0Practicing contraception, whether through modern or traditional means, is critical to maternal and child welfare. Access to modern contraception and safe abortion is also a major factor in women pursuing higher education, joining the workforce and delaying marriage. Globally, an estimated 225 million women have an unmet need for voluntary reproductive health care', 'Educational attainment also influences the dynamics of fertility and therefore projections of future population growth. Among educational factors influencing population growth, universal access to and equal quality of education, as well as reproductive health-specific education, are predominant. In most contexts, education influences timing of marriage, timing of births, desired family size, and total number of births. Men and women with more schooling tend to marry later, delay childbearing longer, and have fewer children than their peers with less education. The impact of education on fertility is context-specific and varies by a country’s stage of development—with the educational composition of women in countries that have yet to complete the demographic transition having a particularly strong effect on fertility and future population', 'Methodology\nRecognizing that there are differences in emissions per capita (i.e., productive and consumptive behavior is not consistent across populations), generally speaking fewer emitters means fewer emissions. This analysis models the impact of increased adoption of family planning from 2020 to 2050 on emissions from energy use, building space, food, waste, and transportation by comparing two scenarios: a high adoption scenario, in which there is increased adoption of family planning, and\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario with no additional investment in family planning', 'The most cited literature for population projections is the UN Population Prospect, released by the United Nations Population Division Department of Economic and Social Affairs every 2 years.[1] The UN population projections rely on use of three key inputs to determine the growth in population:\xa0fertility, mortality,\xa0 and international migration\xa0(World Population Prospects, 2010). Using these parameter inputs, the UN generates several variants of population projections, including high, medium, constant, and low variants. This analysis adopts a blend of the UN 2015 high, constant, and medium variants, depending on the current net reproductive rates (NRR) and economic status of countries as the Reference Scenario. An ambitious population scenario was constructed from the UN medium and low variants representing a declining fertility trend in high and medium fertility countries attributable to an optimistic assumption of effective uptake of family planning and education', 'Each Project Drawdown solution model measures growth, demand, and impact using the UN medium variant. To model the impact of family planning as a solution, we calculate the per capita functional market demand according the UN medium variant, and, all other things being equal, apply the per capita demand to the blended high population scenario. This gives us an estimation of the increased demand required to meet the expected needs of the higher population scenario across all models. Emission results associated with this increased demand are aggregated to produce cumulative emissions impacts by sector', 'Impacts of increased adoption of family planning from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on only one growth scenario, which is assessed in comparison with\xa0a Reference Scenario. More aggressive population reduction scenarios were not considered', 'Financial Model\nNo financial analysis was conducted for family planning', 'Results\nThe results of Scenario 1 and 2 show that reducing estimated population size could avoid 85.42 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from 2020 to 2050. It is assumed that this impact is a result of a combination of providing voluntary reproductive health resources and universal access to and equal quality of education to boys and girls', 'Discussion\nDemographic change, including population growth, age distribution, extent of urbanization, and household size, all affect consumption and production of energy, and therefore emissions (O’Neill et al, 2012). Of those demographic changes, population growth offers the potential to be substantial solution to global warming. A number of simulation models have demonstrated that decreasing the rate of population growth could substantially reduce global carbon dioxide emissions (O’Neill et al., 2010). Using UN population projections from 2004, O’Neill et al. estimate that if countries’ total fertility rate followed the low rather than medium variant, worldwide emissions would be reduced by 1.4 gigatons of carbon\xa0per year in 2050. However, if the population were to follow the high variant, emissions would increase by 1.7 gigatons of carbon\xa0per year in 2050 (O’Neill et al., 2012). Although there is a lack of consensus over the precise weight and significance of the various interactions among\xa0educational attainment, contraceptive use, and fertility outcomes, it is clear that these complementary interventions are important to population reduction and emissions reductions', 'To date, the success of international family planning has been the result of marked changes in policy, financing, political will, technology, social norms, and behavior change. Since the 1960s, average family size has halved from six children per woman to three. However, actual family size still exceeds desired family size in many countries, largely because an estimated 225 million do not have access to modern methods of contraception. Expanding family planning to those couples wishing to better time and space their births remains a challenge. Since the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and Development, family planning has been absorbed into the broader concept of reproductive health. The conference shifted the paradigm of family planning away from being discussed as an issue of population and development and reframed it as a matter of women’s health, rights, and empowerment.\xa0 This reframing as well as the diversion of funding towards HIV/AIDS has led to inadequate funds for reproductive health services', 'Due to population momentum, the population projections for the medium and high variant scenarios diverge much more drastically in the second half of the century. Thus, while the contribution of family planning to drawing down emissions up to 2050 is important, the longer-term benefits will be far greater, since the Plausible Scenario would result in an age structure leading to further slowdown in population growth.

34,High-Efficiency Heat Pumps,"['Project Drawdown defines high-efficiency heat pumps as\xa0high-efficiency[1] electrical devices that harvest latent heat from ambient sources such as the ground, air, or water for use in the conditioned space via the compression and expansion of a working fluid (refrigerant). This solution replaces new and existing conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, including gas- and oil-fired furnaces, gas- and oil-fired boilers, low-efficiency air conditioners of all types (room-based, window units, central), electric resistance furnaces, and electric resistance unit heaters in both residential and commercial applications', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for heat pumps is based on estimated supply for commercial and residential building space-heating in terawatt-hours from 2020 to 2050, derived from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) data. Current adoption[2] of high-efficiency heat pumps was estimated to be 3 percent of the market for delivered heat', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of heat pumps from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', 'Data on global adoption scenarios of heat pumps remains sparse. It is estimated that improved HVAC equipment can reduce the overall demand for space heating and cooling 25–70 percent. As one of the most efficient of those HVAC systems, heat pumps generally, and high-efficiency heat pumps specifically, must play a key role in that. The scenarios below are aligned to the IEA scenarios with more explicitly aggressive and improving efficiencies (seasonal coefficients of performance, SCOPs[3]). Aggressive growth of high-efficiency heat pumps can be expected globally as prices continue to decrease', 'For heat pumps, two scenarios for heat delivery (as oppose to cooling) were developed:\n\nScenario 1: Using the IEA’s 2017 ETP 2DS Scenario, we project the total demand for all heat pumps, and then apply an assumed linearly increasing SCOP from 2.9 (average today) to 3.5 in 2060', 'Scenario 2: Using the IEA’s 2017 ETP B2DS Scenario, we project the total demand for all heat pumps, and then apply an assumed linearly increasing SCOP from 2.9 (average today) to 4.3 in 2060', '\nEmissions Model\nIt is assumed that high-efficiency heat pumps replace coal, gas, and oil boilers as well as electric resistance heaters in a ratio defined by their share of total heating final energy based on IEA data for the globe. For every terawatt-hour (therm) of delivered heat produced by high-efficiency heat pumps, an equivalent amount of energy would be avoided from the heating systems mentioned above. While the replacement of these high-emissions technologies for electricity-based heat pumps will increase the overall usage of electricity, overall energy savings are achieved through reduced direct fuel combustion and an increase in efficiency in electricity use. Grid and fuel emissions are included and emission factors come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data', 'Financial Model\nThe first costs of high efficiency heat pumps are estimated at US$9911 per installation unit, compared to a weighted cost of US$7915 per unit for conventional HVAC systems.[4] Costs are equal to the sum of the retail price of the equipment and any material or labor costs necessary for installation. The reported installation costs for conventional technologies are weighted by residential and commercial applications, at 75 and 25 percent, respectively. The source for these values comes from the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), IEA, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). A set of published learning rate data for air conditioning units was collected and use with the assumption that air conditioning units are sufficiently close enough to heat pumps', 'Operating costs include\xa0building heating energy (fuel and electricity).

35,High-Performance Glass,"['Project Drawdown defines high-performance glass as\xa0any of several mature static glass technologies that can reduce heat flow across the glass including multiple layers, low-emissivity glass, tinted glass, and vacuum glazing. This solution replaces conventional plain glass', 'Different high-performance glass technologies have been around for decades and have been proven in commercial and residential buildings to reduce heat loss in colder climates and heat gain in warmer climates. These technologies therefore promise energy savings for thermal systems in buildings and the various technologies have different applications appropriate to their configuration and cost. High-performance glass can greatly reduce the inefficiency of building windows but adoption is limited in some regions. In this report, we examine the potential financial and climate impact of increased adoption of high-performance glass instead of plain glass', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[1]\nThe total addressable market (TAM) for high-performance glass was calculated using the Project Drawdown integrated buildings TAM model which collectively calculates the TAMs of building floor area, roof area, space heating and cooling, and all other floor-area driven TAM’s used in the building sector. The estimated TAMs are also subdivided by building type (residential and commercial), and by building climate zone[2]. This model used numerous sources. The total addressable market for architectural glass was determined based on the estimated growth in floor area from this model and the average (residential and commercial) window-to-floor-area ratios from several sources. Data on high-performance glass market share estimates by region were used to estimate the solution’s current adoption[3] in square meters of glass installed (5 billion in residential and 130 million in commercial) and in square meters of floor area “adopted”\xa0(33 billion in residential and 1.7 billion in commercial). Since there was already high adoption of high-performance glass in commercial buildings of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), this region was excluded from the model for commercial high-performance glass (it was included in dynamic glass)', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nImpacts of increased adoption of high-performance glass from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels. The high growth scenarios were based on assumed retrofit rates:\n\nScenario 1: For the residential windows, an assumed retrofit rate of 2.3 percent was used for existing building areas, but an increasing percentage (50 to 100 percent) of new construction was assumed to use high performance windows. Similarly for commercial buildings, 2.75 percent of existing buildings were assumed to be retrofitted annually to high performance windows, and 50 to 100 percent of new commercial areas assumed to adopt the solution', 'Scenario 2: For the residential windows, an assumed retrofit rate of 5 percent was used for existing building areas, but an increasing percentage (50–100 percent) of new construction was assumed to use high-performance windows. Similarly for commercial buildings, 5 percent of existing buildings were assumed to be retrofitted annually to high-performance windows, and 50–100 percent of new commercial areas assumed to adopt the solution', '\nEmissions Model\nHeating and cooling energy data for buildings were obtained from several sources. Energy efficiency of heating, and cooling were all found to be between 6 and 9 percent for commercial buildings, but 13 – 17 percent for residential buildings. Electricity and fuel consumption were included, and emissions factors were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs of high-performance glass are three to five times those of plain glass and no learning rate was applied since these technologies are generally mature. Operating costs of the glass itself were not included, but cooling and heating costs were included for areas adopted with high-performance glass and with plain glass using global average data', 'Integration[5]\nThe high-performance glass solution was integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing all solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions like Insulation were first, building systems like BAS were second, and building applications like Heat Pumps were last.[6] The impact on building energy demand was calculated for highest-priority solutions, and energy-related high-performance glass input values were reduced to represent the impact of higher building envelope solutions. The output from the high-performance glass model was used as the input in lower-priority solutions', 'Results\nScenario 1 forecasts that 26.6 billion and 7 billion square meters of high-performance glass could be installed by 2050 in residences and commercial buildings respectively. This could avoid 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions and $3.4 trillion in lifetime energy costs. The net cost, however,\xa0compared with\xa0the Reference Scenario would be $3.2\xa0trillion.[7]\nThe Scenario 2 (glass area adoption grows to 31.7 billion square meters in residences and 7.5 billion square meters in commercial buildings by 2050) shows 12.6 gigatons of emissions reduced with $3.9 trillion in energy savings over building lifetimes for a cost of $3.4\xa0trillion', 'Discussion\nIt is clear that high-performance glass would have to drop significantly in price to be economically viable in the regions studied. This may be a factor of low energy prices, and helps to explain why after so many years of availability on the market, many areas haven’t adopted high performing glass. Without some interventions that lower the upfront costs to installation, there is limited incentive for building owners to install high performance glass in a world of low energy prices despite the climate benefits. A further split of the energy costs into cooling and heating separately along with a similar split in heating and cooling energy demands in each region might shed more light on the market dynamics and potential for high-performance glass to reduce emissions and building thermal costs. Note also that the use of global averages hides the vast range in building energy used in residential buildings which depend on a number of factors including thermal comfort requirements in individual households', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] For more on the Total Addressable Market for the Buildings Sector, click the Sector Summary: Buildings link below', '\n\n[2] We were guided by the ASHRAE 169 building climate zone standards\n\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

36,High-Speed Rail,"['Project Drawdown defines high-speed rail as: track construction for increased use of high-speed rail for intercity travel. This solution replaces other forms of travel, such as by airplane and by internal combustion engine (ICE) car', 'High-speed rail (HSR) has experienced significant growth in recent decades, especially in China, whose HSR network grew to almost 30,000 kilometers in a few years, representing around two thirds of the global total. Growth is expected to continue as China and the European Union add to their extensive networks and new countries build their first links. This report seeks to quantify the greenhouse gas emission reductions and costs associated with increased HSR travel', 'Project Drawdown takes the definition of the International Railway Union (UIC)[1] for HSR as a railway system where tracks are “…new lines designed for speeds above 250 km/hr and in some cases, upgraded existing lines for speeds up to 220km/hr.”[2] HSR’s most noted competitor—airplanes—emit more greenhouse gases per passenger-kilometer than HSR.[3] Thus, while HSR is a solution to multiple high-emitting modes of transportation, this study focuses on the replacement of air travel specifically', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[4]\nThe total addressable market for HSR is defined as the total non-urban travel projected by key sources like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). The current market share[5] of HSR is estimated from UIC and Amtrak data. The data shows that just over 3.2 percent of the global market is provided by HSR on the world’s existing HSR tracks', 'Adoption Scenarios[6]\nProjections of HSR adoption are based on announced plans for HSR track construction, which is chiefly done by governments. Using UIC data and other web searches, estimates were collected of total track length under construction and planned, along with estimated completion dates. Total track length estimates amount to 49,000 kilometers', 'As HSR has very different travel densities, or usage rates, in different parts of the world, the travel densities for countries with existing HSR were collected, and these values were used to predict the passenger-kilometers for new tracks.[7] For countries without any existing tracks, travel densities of the most similar country or region with HSR tracks were used', 'Impacts of increased adoption of high-speed rail from 2020-2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where total HSR travel remains fixed at the current levels (3.2 percent of the total market)', '\nScenario 1: The potential adoption was determined based on the total announced track construction with the expected completion dates, and the travel densities of each country with an additional 1 percent annual growth rate applied to HSR travel on existing tracks', 'Scenario 2: The same inputs were used as in the Scenario 1 above, but a 2.5 percent annual growth in the travel density of each country was applied', '\nEmissions Model\nFor operating emissions, increased grid electricity use from HSR adoption was included, along with jet fuel emissions for the conventional alternative. Indirect emissions were also included for infrastructure operations', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs for HSR were considered as track construction costs. A value of US$27.2 million per track-kilometer was used,[8] corresponding to the global average.[9] For the conventional alternative, aviation, no first costs were entered since the marginal costs for new flight routes is not only very low (compared to that for HSR routes), but they are also quite hidden since it involves an airline doing business analysis on its existing services, and possibly negotiating with local airports, governments and providers. It could also mean, setting up a new office in a new airport destination, but if the new link is between two airports where the airline already has operations, then this cost would be zero. As a result of all these unknowns, the first costs for new airline links has been set to zero', 'Operating costs for HSR and the conventional alternative include operations and maintenance costs of the infrastructure and energy for train motion (grid electricity), airports (ground operations) and aircraft (jet A/A1 fuel). For the train, these are normalized on a per passenger-km or track-km basis. For aviation, this was normalized on a per passenger-km or available seat-km basis', 'Results\nThe Scenario 1 estimates an emissions reduction of 1.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases over the 2020-2050 period at the end of which would exist 81,000 km of track or about 30,000 more than today. Most emissions reductions will come from Asia due to the extensive HSR growth planned in China. Globally, this is expected to result in an additional US$612 billion in construction costs, and should incur an additional US$849 billion in operating costs over the lifetime. In the Scenario 2, the avoided emissions could be as high as 3.8 gigatons', 'Discussion\nOther benefits of HSR not calculated in this model include: reduced road congestion, fewer road accidents, lower local pollution and noise, less susceptibility to weather than aviation, easier and more comfortable travel. As indicated in our results, however, HSR is expensive to build, with higher expenses for higher speeds. Some research points to positive economic effects of HSR, but it is unclear whether these are actually generated by HSR or merely re-distributed to other regions', 'A policy of encouraging more usage of existing HSR tracks does make sense, as that improves the solution’s climate and financial impacts, and as the marginal cost of adding more trains is very low. The EU has this policy, and we see many more countries following suit. We also expect increased travel on Chinese lines which already have excellent coverage of the country', 'Often transport impact analyses use some sort of choice model, but this is not possible at the global level because of sparse data. Our approach is reasonable since it is grounded in firm construction announcements and existing travel. Due to the high quality of HSR travel, it tends to attract many air travelers on reasonable-length routes,[10] but it also attracts people who would have used cars or conventional rail, or who would not have traveled at all before HSR. We did not model this diversity of alternatives due to the inherent complexity in identifying and combining worldwide data', 'The positive effects of HSR can be maximized by building HSR lines in travel corridors where the train will compete for travelers with higher-polluting travel modes such as airlines and automobiles, and where travel demand \xa0is already high such as between larger cities in close proximity', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] UIC means “International Railway Union” in French (Union Internationale de Chemins–de-fer)', '\n\n[2] 250 km/h = 155 mph, 220 km/h = 136 mph\n\n\n[3] This is generally the case even when infrastructure emissions are included, but depends heavily on the number of people in the HSR train and in the aircraft. Emissions per passenger-kilometer for a full aircraft can be lower than that of an almost empty train.

37,Hybrid Cars,"['Project Drawdown defines the hybrid cars solution as\xa0the increased use of hybrid cars (not plug-in hybrids). This solution replaces the use of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars', 'Increasing the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles is a key strategy to reduce fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation. Fuel efficiency can be affected by many factors, including: vehicle technology and design, driver behavior, and road infrastructure. This study focuses on the hybridization of the drive train, which accounts for over 40 percent of the improvement potential in conventional gasoline car fuel consumption – the largest impact available from a single technology[1]. This work compares the potential financial and environmental impacts of a rapid global adoption of hybrid cars to a scenario in which adoption remains at its current level', 'Hybrid electric vehicles supplement an internal combustion engine with at least one electric motor and a battery large enough to power the vehicle by generated electricity. They are distinct from electric vehicles which are powered, in part[2] or in whole, by grid electricity. Hybrid electric vehicles have greater fuel efficiency than ICE cars because they use stop-start technology, which reduces idle time, and regenerative braking, which recovers the energy that would otherwise be dissipated when brakes are applied', 'Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market[3]\nThe total addressable market for this technology is total urban and nonurban global passenger-kilometers, projected to 2050. Data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) are used to determine the urban segment common to all urban transportation solutions. Global adoption in 2018 was based on estimates of the historical and projected fractions of light duty vehicles that are hybrid, and on average estimates of total light duty vehicle passenger-kilometers[4]. Future adoption was calculated differently depending on the scenario', 'Adoption Scenarios[5]\nImpacts of increased adoption of cars from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario where the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: Here, the average of collected conservative projections from several sources is used. It is also assumed that 50 percent of hybrid passenger-kilometers are urban each year', 'Scenario 2: An assumption of a transition to EVs is used where hybrid adoption first grows according to the IEA 2DS scenario until the late 2040s, when adoption declines. Also, 50 percent of hybrid passenger-kilometers are urban each year until 2030 when it declines', '\nEmissions Model\nFuel emissions were based on the global average fuel economy, and indirect emissions from construction of the vehicles were included (hybrids were found to emit slightly more per vehicle)', 'Financial Model\nPurchase costs for hybrids and ICE cars were estimated using price data available in the USA, EU, and Japan, as well as global weighted averages. Although car prices may change, no learning rate was assumed for ICE’s or hybrid vehicles', 'Operating costs include fixed costs, such as insurance, as well as variable maintenance and fuel costs, which represent the main difference between the two technologies. The fuel costs were based on an average global fuel economy using 19 data points, and on the average fuel price over 2007–2018', 'Integration[6]\nConsistency with other solutions (such as electric vehicles) was maintained by using harmonized inputs for ICE car price, fuel economy, etc. The total adoption of hybrids is limited by the market, since hybrids were lowest in integration priority[7] of all the urban solution modes due to its high energy, emissions and space requirements. The Optimum Scenario, therefore, resulted in lower hybrid use in urban environments compared to other scenarios. Additionally, as the hybrids were integrated with the Carpooling solution, over time, increased occupancy of hybrids was assumed over time as the Carpooling solution adoption increased. This changed the fuel consumption variables', 'Results\nIn 2050, Scenario 1 projects 621 million hybrids on the road, resulting in the reduction of 7.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions due to lower fuel consumption (over 2020–2050). This includes the increased indirect emissions associated with the production of hybrid vehicles. Lifetime operating costs[8] are reduced by US$6 trillion[9] compared with\xa0a business-as-usual Reference Scenario for an increased purchase costs of US$3.6\xa0trillion', 'Scenario 2 has 236 million hybrids on the road in 2050, and sees 4.6 gigatons of emissions avoided (both lower than the Plausible due to a transitioning to EVs)', 'Discussion\nWith the understanding that gasoline-powered cars will not disappear immediately, hybrid electric vehicles can be a good mid-term solution for mitigating transportation emissions, as their price differential with ICE vehicles is not as large as EVs but their development can help electric vehicle technology grow (as batteries get better). Hybrids can take market share from ICE cars while potential zero-carbon transport methods, such as electric vehicles that run entirely on battery power, continue to improve. This may require increased investment to reduce the premium over ICE cars, and/or subsidies to attract demand. There might be improvements in internal combustion engine technology that reduce the impacts calculated. From a societal perspective, replacing ICE cars with hybrids results in lower greenhouse gas and other air pollutant emissions associated with adverse health effects. There are some challenges with hybrid adoption however, since the vast majority of sales happen in Japan led by Toyota (including its best-selling model, the Prius). Our data show that from 1999-2017, 59% of Hybrid sales were in Japan. The growth of HEV adoption is therefore currently dependent on Japan but Japan represents only 4-5 million out of over 80 million annual passenger vehicles sold. With current global HEV stocks estimated to be 15-16 million, there is much room to grow. Other major markets such as China and the US would need to complement their EV-support policies with HEV-support policies to help encourage adoption.

38,Improved Clean Cookstoves,"['Project Drawdown defines clean cookstoves as solar-powered or fuel-burning household stoves that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing thermal efficiency, reducing specific emissions, or increasing ventilation. This solution replaces traditional cookstoves that burn wood and/or charcoal inefficiently and without ventilation', 'Currently, about one-third of world’s population (2.7 billion people) depends on solid fuels including fuelwood and crop residue, for cooking. This is projected to increase by 8 percent by 2030. These traditional cooking practices impact not only global carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from fuel combustion, but also the health of rural populations of the developing world due to household air pollution. Traditional stoves can be improved in three different ways, as named above. The type of cookstove is determined by the International Organization for Standardization tier based on thermal efficiency and emissions. Tiers 0 and 1 constitute the basic, traditional, solid-fuel-based stoves. Tiers 2–4 are considered improved clean cookstoves.[1]\nThis analysis evaluates the growth of improved clean cookstoves as a replacement for traditional cookstoves around the world.[2]\nMethodology\nTotal Addressable Market[3]\nThe total addressable market is defined as the total terawatt-hour therms final energy used for cooking in all regions except OECD90 and Eastern Europe (that is, Middle East & Africa, Asian sans Japan, and Latin America). From the literature review, assumptions were derived for population growth, average population per household, average household useful energy use for cooking per capita, a weighted average energy efficiency factor for stove and fuel type mix, and the percentage of the population using solid fuels. These values, along with global data from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2006 and 2012), were used to develop a composite global market for the period 2014–2050', 'Current adoption[4] of clean cookstoves was estimated at 53 percent of families in the regions selected for this analysis. This figure was derived, in part, from data on clean cooking as guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) which call for universal access to clean energy by 2030 which would have significant health and societal benefits for the families involved', 'Adoption Scenarios[5]\nImpacts of increased adoption of clean cookstoves from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios.

The IEA has developed a Sustainable Energy Scenario (SES) which matches the UN goal', 'For clean cookstoves, two scenarios were developed:\n\nScenario 1: Aligned growth that matches the IEA New Policies Scenario (NPS)\nScenario 2: full achievement of the UN SDG of 100 percent access to clean cooking by 2030 using linear projections of adoption in each region included in the analysis (aligned with the IEA Sustainable Energy Scenario (SES)', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions mitigation variables were based on several peer-reviewed sources and weighting, calculating an estimated 43 percent of fuel saved from the clean cookstoves compared to the traditional stoves', 'In addition to carbon dioxide emissions, black carbon is also an important factor to consider for the clean cookstoves solution. There is wide consensus on the impact of black carbon, but its magnitude is still under study—mainly because of the impacts of other components emitted with it during open combustion, such as organic carbon. Organic carbon consists of scattering particles and aerosols that are considered to have a global cooling effect. Black carbon data from 12 sources were included, and this contributed a significant portion of the emissions reduction', 'Financial Model\nFinancial variables (the costs of traditional and improved stoves) have largely been obtained from sources such as the World Bank (2010) and US EPA (2015). Weighting based on cooking fuel mix was applied where possible. The average first cost of a conventional stove was found to be US$1.28 since these are simple devices often consisting of nothing more than three stones arranged on the ground to hold up a pot. However, the average first cost of an improved clean cookstove was found to be US$45.[6] Operating cost data was less available. Much of the fuel required for traditional wood-burning stoves is not purchased but collected by women in rural parts of the developing world, so the cost of fuel is weighted appropriately', 'Integration[7]\nIntegration of cooking solutions was mainly to avoid double counting, and a prioritization was applied where the other cooking solution, Biogas for Cooking was seen as one with a more limited scope so was considered of higher priority for the applicable locations. Clean Cookstoves therefore were limited in adoption if total functional units adopted between Biogas for Cooking and Clean Cookstoves exceeded the cooking energy TAM', 'Results\nThe total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions that can be achieved from 2020–2050 in Scenario 1 are 31 gigatons carbon dioxide equivalent (including an attribution of 8 gigatons from black carbon). This scenario would cost an additional US$136\xa0billion and would raise lifetime operating costs by US$2.0 trillion since families would now have to pay for something that used to be free (if their time for collecting firewood was discounted). Still only 84 percent of families in the three developing regions selected would have access to clean cooking, with Africa being the furthest behind, considering its slow adoption of clean cooking technologies', 'Scenario 2 of achieving the UN SDG for universal access by 2030 would see a reduction of 73 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents inclusive of 20 gigatons from black carbon reduction. This would cost an additional US$291\xa0billion in stove costs and US$4.2 trillion in lifetime fuel and operating costs', 'Discussion\nClean cookstoves are an important solution to consider for drawdown. It should be noted that 17 percent of the world’s black carbon comes from biomass-based cooking, and reducing this value to almost zero by replacing solid fuel-burning stoves with renewable fuel stoves is a huge step towards drawdown. The source of solid-wood fuel is not considered in this model, but the nature of clean cookstoves enables solid fuel of size and density that could come from regenerative forest management and not subsistence clear-cutting', 'In addition to climate impacts, the health impacts of this solution are significant. Our model estimates that in the Scenario 1, over 3 billion tons of carbon monoxide, 180 million tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 28 million tons of nitrous oxide can be avoided through clean cookstove adoption.\xa0 In India, it was estimated that the dissemination of 150 million clean cookstoves over 10 years could help avoid 2.2 million premature deaths due to household air pollution in the country, and that the reduction in health burden in 2020 (measured in lost healthy life years) would be equivalent to about half the total national cancer burden projected that year.

Indigenous peoples have claim to large tracts of forest land around the world, and the current global trend is that indigenous peoples’ legal forest tenure is on the rise', 'Granting indigenous peoples and local communities secure tenure to manage their lands thus results in carbon benefits in the form of reduced emissions from deforestation and continued carbon sequestration.

A World Resources Institute study calculated that secure forest tenure for indigenous people in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia could reduce emissions by 42.8–59.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent through 2035, on 148.9 million hectares. The Project Drawdown model shows a global impact of 288.6–431.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for 2035, on 869–1046 million hectares among\xa0our three scenarios. Comparing the ratio of million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to million hectares, the World Resources Institute study benchmark is 0.28–0.40, while the Project Drawdown model calculates 0.33–0.41 in the two scenarios; thus, results are similar. Griscom et al. (2017)’s “natural climate solutions” calculates an annual impact from “avoided forest conversion” of 1.82–3.60 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030.

41,Insulation,"['Project Drawdown defines insulation as\xa0the use of high levels of improved materials in building envelopes that resist heat flow and regulate indoor temperatures. This solution replaces the conventional practice of using less thermal resistance in residential and commercial buildings', 'Insulating the wall and roof surface area of buildings is one of the most accessible and effective ways to reduce heating and cooling energy use—and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions—in the built environment. Increasing insulation of older buildings through retrofit and increasing the average R-value of new building stock costs more than current normal practices, but has a significant return on investment from lower operating costs due to reductions in heating and cooling costs. All materials are not the same however since some require manufacture processes that generate much emissions, these are called embodied emissions of insulation. There are many low carbon bio-based materials like waste paper and hemp that can lower these embodied emissions significantly, but they may not be applicable in all cases', 'Methodology\nTo determine the emissions reduction potential of global adoption of high quality insulation in climate appropriate regions, the global stock of buildings was first analyzed to determine a total addressable market of building surface area appropriate for insulation. We separated the heating-dominated from the cooling-dominated areas and estimated possible heat loss or heat gain due to buildings of today’s average u-values in different climate zones according to heating-degree days and cooling-degree days. The energy loss (gain) is used to estimate the energy demand for heating (cooling) which was used to benchmark again global estimates for final space heating (cooling) energy. Then we adjusted the u-values to align with Passive House standards for heating dominated climates (and slightly less ambitious for cooling-dominated) and estimated the thermal energy saved. This was converted to emissions according to global average heating and cooling energy emissions factors', 'We additionally estimated the typical shares of materials used for insulation and estimated the embodied emissions of each but with an assumption that low-carbon materials like waste paper (cellulose) and hemp increase from an estimated 6 percent of total to 30 percent', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for insulation is based on estimated supply for commercial and residential building space in million square meters from 2020 to 2050, derived from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) data', 'With very limited data, we have assumed that current adoption[1] of insulation corresponds to around 30 percent globally', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of insulation from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: For this scenario, an insulation retrofit rate of 1.6 percent was applied', 'Scenario 2: For this scenario, an insulation retrofit rate of 2 percent was applied', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions assumptions were based on a combination of emissions factors related to heating fuel and grid electricity factors for cooling energy using global average heating and cooling demands, and the emissions factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Additionally the embodied emissions from typical insulation materials were collected from industry sources', 'Financial Model\nFinancial variables were collected and assessed for the costs of a variety of common insulation materials, including cellulose, polyurethane, stone and glass wools. Estimated thickness of each material to obtain the required u-value were estimated and used to price the per square-meter insulation need of each material before weighting by market demand. Over time the market shares would shift as more low carbon materials are used, and this was taken into account. The average first cost per square meter of insulated surface was estimated as US$4.00 more than typical levels of insulation.[2] Operational savings were derived by multiplying the reduced heating and cooling use by the average costs for the type of heating or cooling that would have been delivered', 'Integration\nThe insulation solution was integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing all solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions like insulation were first, building systems like building automation systems\xa0were second, and building applications like heat pumps were last.[3] The impact on building energy demand was calculated for highest priority solutions, and then lower priority solutions were adjusted accordingly. For integrating Project Drawdown solutions in the Building Sector, insulation was the first solution to be considered because of the low cost, likely adoption, and significant mitigation impact of bolstering the building envelope. All other building envelope and building solutions impacting heating and cooling use are impacted by insulation at the point of integration', 'Additionally, as this model’s result is partly dependent on the supply of biogenic low carbon materials like hemp, and waste materials like waste paper, Project Drawdown’s integrated biomass and integrated waste models included allocations for Insulation to ensure that no double counting or unrealistic projections occurred', 'Results\nScenario 1 results show a mitigation impact of 17 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over the period 2020–2050 and US$21 trillion in energy savings. This scenarios estimates an additional US$751 billion in insulation cost. The increased adoption of insulation in Scenario 2 results in a mitigation impact of 19 gigatons of emissions for a cost of US$831 billion. \xa0It does, however, save an estimated US$24 trillion in heating and cooling costs', 'Discussion\nThere is little peer-reviewed literature assessing the potential global increased adoption of insulation, so the results developed require a significant number of assumptions and reasoned extrapolations of the data that does exist. Temperature variation and human comfort levels in buildings can significantly affect the adoption of insulation. Because of rising outside temperatures, Anthropogenic global warming is expected to decrease average energy used for heating buildings worldwide, but is also expected to drive more electricity use for cooling. These effects were not considered for the model prognostications', 'The impact of the low-carbon materials is noticeable. This contributed to a higher emission impact than would have been estimated. The building\xa0industry is coming to the realization that unless embodied emissions are taken into account when retrofitting or designing new buildings, significant emissions may be generated from the built environment. The need to have a holistic view on emissions caused by building construction is being recognized in greater amounts. Related Project Drawdown solutions on this topic are alternative cement\xa0and building with wood. Alternative cement\xa0is a\xa0way\xa0that one of the most common building materials, cement—currently the source of 5 percent\xa0of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions—can be made more carbon efficient. Building with wood, a Project Drawdown coming attraction, is also a potentially high-impact solution to reducing building embodied emissions', 'One reason why we did not apply the Passive House standard to cooling dominated climates is the large increase in embodied emissions that we estimated would occur to install insulation of such a high level. Part of this, we believe, is due to higher balance temperatures in some countries, and limited wealth in others. These, combined, result in lower use of cooling energy in the conventional case than what our data would suggest', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018. This study uses 2014 as the base year', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$', '\n\n[3] Although we used the term “priority,”\xa0we do not mean to say that any solution was of greater importance than any other, but rather that for estimating total impact of all building solutions, we simply applied the impacts of some solutions before others, and used the output energy demand after application of a higher priority solution as the energy demand input to a lower priority solution.']"
42,Landfill Methane Capture,"['Project Drawdown defines landfill methane capture as\xa0the process of capturing methane generated from anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste in landfills and incinerating the captured biogas to generate electricity. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Landfill methane capture is most effective in closed and engineered landfills, achieving 85 percent efficiency or more; it is least effective in open dumps, where the collection efficiency is approximately 10 percent and capture is typically not seen as an economically favorable decision. As a waste treatment solution, from a climate perspective, landfill methane capture is generally seen as preferable only to landfilling without methane capture. However, where landfills exist it is an important solution for mitigating greenhouse gases', 'Methodology\nThis analysis models the impacts of the adoption of landfill methane capture for electricity generation and gas flaring. Landfill methane capture is a mature technology which has been used widely for decades', 'Total Addressable Market\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration. The total addressable market for landfill methane capture is based on projected global electricity generation from 2020 to 2050. Current adoption[1] is considered to be 33.1 terawatt-hours, or 0.13 percent of total electricity generated worldwide. Total adoption estimates vary widely between different future adoption prognostications, due to the fact that different sources place a different value on biomass and waste for energy adoption', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of landfill methane capture\xa0from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios derived from the evaluation of several global energy system modeling scenarios. These scenarios were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', 'The sources used do not clearly depict landfill methane capture and biogas technologies for electricity generation adoption pathways; instead, their results combine biomass and waste for electricity generation. Therefore, a few assumptions were made to determine future adoption: Biogas represents around 20 percent of total electricity generation from bioenergy worldwide, and biogas from landfills covered within this solution represents 30 percent of total biogas. The remaining 70 percent is covered by methane capture from agriculture, manure, and wastewater', 'For landfill methane capture, the two scenarios developed are:\n\nScenario 1: Due to landfill methane capture’s low priority in waste management ranking, Scenario 1 is built upon four conservative scenarios from\xa0the EU project AMPERE (2014) GEM-E3 Refpol scenario, the 4°C and 6°C Scenarios of the International Energy Agency’s 2016 Energy Technology Perspectives (IEA ETP, 2016), and Greenpeace (2015) Reference Scenario. After integration on the waste cluster integration model to adjust the adoption based on feedstock availability, Scenario 1 foresees landfill methane capture representing only 0.05 percent of the market share in 2050', 'Scenario 2: This scenario follows ambitious adoption projections from the AMPERE (2014) IMAGE Refpol, 550 and 450 scenarios,\xa0GEM-E3 model in the 450 and 550 scenarios, and the 2°C Scenario of the International Energy Agency’s 2016 Energy Technology Perspectives (IEA ETP, 2016).

Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity-generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nThe results for the Scenario 1 show that through the advanced adoption of landfill methane capture, installed in over 70 percent of the world’s landfills, the marginal first costs compared to the Reference Scenario would be –US$4.31 billion from 2020 to 2050 and approximately –US$6.89 billion in lifetime savings. The Scenario 1 adoption of landfill methane capture would require an estimated US$34.7 billion in cumulative first costs. Under this scenario, landfill methane capture’s adoption trajectory could reduce 2.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2050', 'Due to integration and waste feedstock availability, Scenario 2 depicts negative impacts on greenhouse gas emission reductions over 2020 to 2050 of –1.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent when compared with\xa0a Reference scenario, since the adoption and consequent share of the solution on the total addressable market decrease significantly through the period of analysis', 'Discussion\nThe landfill methane capture solution is a net benefit for the climate, but depending on the region and technologies being used, it might entail increased costs due to the up-front costs required for landfill gas-to-electricity technologies', 'While it is clearly a second-best\xa0waste management strategy, as long as landfills are being created it is still a viable and important solution for climate mitigation. Aside from the significant climate benefits and long-term cost savings shown by this study, landfills that\xa0capture methane are safer and less of a public health hazard than those that\xa0do not.

This is not only due to the high luminous efficacy[1] of LED lighting, but also due to the size of the lighting sector in both residential and commercial buildings', 'Traditionally, there have been four types of lamps used in residential lighting: incandescent lamps, halogen lamps, compact fluorescent lamps, and linear fluorescent lamps.

If the challenges in product quality are overcome, the prices reduced, and the luminous efficacy increased further, LED lighting is expected to take over the residential sector nearly entirely by 2050', 'There has been an additional lighting type used in the commercial sector: high-intensity discharge lamps, but globally, linear fluorescent lamps have traditionally been the most widely used at approximately 75 percent of installed lighting in the commercial sector. However, this is expected to change, as LED lighting products (lamps and luminaires[3]) penetrate the market', 'Project Drawdown’s LED lighting solution takes into account the entire luminaire, including the light source, the control gear, and the luminaire housing. The luminous efficacy of the entire luminaire indicates that LED luminaires are more energy-efficient than conventional technologies. Global estimated average luminous efficacy for all commercial luminaires is: 94 lumens per watt for integrated LED luminaires; 56 lumens per watt for LED luminaires with replaceable LED lamps; 61 lumens per watt for linear fluorescent lamp luminaires; 42 lumens per watt for compact fluorescent lamp luminaires; 63 lumens per watt for high-intensity discharge luminaires; and 12 lumens per watt for incandescent lamp luminaires (all assuming an estimated luminaire efficiency[4] of 70 percent).[5] The most modern conventional technologies, especially linear fluorescent lamp luminaires, may currently have greater overall luminous efficacy than some LED luminaires; however, LED luminaires are expected to reach a luminous efficacy of 230 lumens per watt', 'The analysis below estimates the potential financial and emissions impacts of high adoption of LEDs in residential and commercial buildings, compared to conventional technologies', 'Methodology\nThe implementation unit in the analysis is lumen: a measure of the visible light emitted by a source, corresponding to the rate at which a lamp can produce visible light.[6] The functional unit is lumen-hour, which describes the amount of visible light produced. For residential buildings, only the lamps, not the entire luminaire (housing), were compared. The same luminaires in residential buildings can be equipped with different lamp technologies having the same cap type, facilitating easy replacement. For commercial buildings, the entire luminaire was compared between the conventional and solution technologies', 'Total Addressable Market[7]\nThe total lighting demand was estimated separately for residential and commercial buildings. These are based on the Project Drawdown integrated buildings TAM model which collectively calculates the TAM’s of building floor area, roof area, lighting, and all other floor-area driven TAM’s used in the building sector. The estimated areas are also subdivided by building type (residential and commercial), and by building region. This model used numerous sources. From a total floor area estimate, we apply an estimated lighting demand per floor area to get the annual lighting demand market for LED lighting household (37 petalumen-hours in 2018), and LED lighting commercial (62 petalumen-hours in 2018). These data were from several sources, including the International Energy Agency. Current adoption[8] of LED lighting was estimated to be 3 percent of the total commercial lighting market, and 2 percent of the residential lighting market', 'Adoption Scenarios[9]\nImpacts of increased adoption of LED lighting (commercial) from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: It’s assumed that LED can linearly grow to 90 percent of the residential market\xa0and 80 percent of the commercial market by 2050', 'Scenario 2: It’s assumed that LED can linearly grow to 95 percent of the residential market\xa0and 90 percent of the commercial market by 2050', '\nEmissions Model\nDirect grid emissions (with emissions factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,\xa0IPCC), as well as indirect production emissions, were included in the climate calculations. Emissions from the conventional options were weighted by market share. Commercial LED systems generate 2.4 times as much indirect emissions as weighted conventional options, but residential LED bulbs generate less than their conventional counterparts', 'Financial Model\nFirsts costs for LEDs average at US$61 per kilolumen for the commercial units, and US$17 per kilolumen for residential units.[10] This compares to a weighted conventional average of US$42 per kilolumen and $4.70 per kilolumen for commercial and residential units respectively. A learning rate of 8.31 percent was only applied to the LED. Operating costs account for the price of electricity, and differ for the commercial and residential buildings, and also for different conventional technologies. No maintenance costs were included', 'Integration[11]\nDrawdown’s LED solutions were integrated with others in the Buildings Sector by first prioritizing all solutions according to the point of impact on building energy usage. This meant that building envelope solutions like Insulation were first, building systems like BAS were second, and building applications like Heat Pumps and LEDs were last. Thus, the commercial LED energy saving potential was reduced to represent the prior energy savings of the higher-priority solutions. No integration effects were taken into account in the residential model, as no other Project Drawdown solution affected household lighting', 'Results\nIn Scenario 1, the global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of LED lighting was estimated to be approximately 5.9 gigatons in commercial buildings and 10.2 gigatons in residences over 2020–2050. Additionally, the lifetime operating savings amount to US$1.4 trillion for commercial buildings and US$3.2 trillion for residential buildings at a net cost of less than the conventional options, since LED prices are dropping and LEDs\xa0have long lifetimes (saving of US$1.7 trillion)', 'Scenario 2 shows a very similar impact at 17.5 gigatons overall, at a net installation saving of US$2 trillion, mainly on the commercial side. This produces lifetime operating savings on the order of US$5 trillion', 'Discussion\nLED’s financial potential, high luminous efficacy and long lifetime should be key to rapid adoption in the coming decades, leading to the emissions reduction potential being realized. The purchase price of LED products is still hampering the wider penetration of the technology, but the price is decreasing. LED lighting offers greater energy efficiency compared with\xa0conventional lighting technologies, but its adoption assumes that buyers are aware of and have access to it. To achieve this, educational campaigns can be run, and global distribution should increase as demand rises and prices fall', 'Given the expected future efficacy development, LED lighting should offer even higher energy efficiency compared to conventional lighting technologies soon. In addition, LED lighting enables advanced lighting controls including dimmable lighting, various colors of light, and color tuning', 'Despite the high purchase price, the total life cycle costs of LED commercial lighting are typically somewhat lower than those of conventional technologies due to the low operating costs. The high energy efficiency, reduced operating costs, and reduced amount of greenhouse gas emissions are considered to be the main benefits of LEDs, but the much longer service life—usually 50,000 hours—is also very attractive', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] The amount of visible light produced for a given power supply', '\n\n[2] The amount of visible light produced for a given power supply', '\n\n[3] The light housing', '\n\n[4] Light output ratio', '\n\n[5] A lumen is a measure of the visible light emitted by a source.

44,Low-Flow Fixtures,"['Project Drawdown defines low-flow fixtures as\xa0the use of low-flow showers and taps in the household. This solution replaces the use of conventional taps and showerheads', 'To determine the overall impact of water saving in the home, an analysis of low-flow taps and showerheads was undertaken to estimate the worldwide domestic water savings, energy savings, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions in high-growth scenarios of adoption of these devices. Other water saving measures in the home—such as low-flow toilets and washing machines—may also provide marginal energy savings, but these were not included to simplify the analysis. Taps and showerheads were examined because they are relatively cheap to implement, pose minimal challenges when retrofitting, and can significantly reduce water and energy consumption', 'Methodology \xa0\nTotal Addressable Market\nThis estimate takes into account a growing world population, increasing wealth, and national wealth distributions. The total addressable market (TAM)\xa0is the total amount of residential water demanded globally for populations with a gross domestic product per capita of at least 10,000 international dollars,[1] and amounts to 69 trillion liters in 2018. Populations with lower wealth generally use much less water: in some cases they have no pipe-borne water to their homes, and for 20 percent\xa0of the world’s population water is not even available at community standpipes. Therefore, water-saving devices, which assume pipe-borne water, are not considered for these populations in this analysis', 'For the target market, however, 59 percent of existing faucets and showerheads were taken as low-flow devices in 2018: that is the current adoption.[2] This is based on a survey of 10,000 residents in 10 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We consider that this value may be an overestimate for the entire TAM,\xa0which includes non-OECD countries. However, we also consider that this value, referring to 2007, must be an underestimate for the countries in question for 2018', 'Adoption Scenarios\nThe main drivers of adoption of low-flow taps and showerheads were assumed to be population and wealth, as indicated earlier. Adoption of these devices can increase in two ways:\xa0replacement of high-flow devices for the remaining percent of the market (retrofitting), and increasing the number of people above the minimum wealth threshold (rising wealth)', 'Impacts of increased adoption of low-flow fixtures from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: In this scenario, a 3 percent retrofit rate is assumed on existing fixtures of the TAM (assumed to equate to the existing Reference water demand) and 65 percent of all new Reference demand is assumed to use the solution\nScenario 2: In this scenario, a 5 percent retrofit rate is assumed on existing fixtures of the TAM (assumed to equate to the existing Reference water demand) and 80 percent of all new Reference demand is assumed to use the solution\n\nIn both scenarios, the water demand drops as a result of the solution adoption which saves 15.8 percent of water on average', 'Emissions Model\nGrid emissions were captured for water heating was done by electric heaters, and that less water used meant less water heated. Fuel consumed for water heating was also estimated and heated water saved translated to fuel saved. For these, emissions factors guided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used', 'Financial Model\nPurchase costs for adoption of low-flow fixtures as well as conventional fixtures were estimated using 38 total data points, and combined with 6 data points on professional installation costs to estimate the total first costs at US$25 per low-flow fixture.[3] Operating cost differences were averaged from 10 data points and were assigned to the conventional fixtures, with operating costs for the solution kept at 0. This represented the cost difference only, and included the cost of the water saved', 'Results \xa0\nThe results of Scenario 1 suggest that the greenhouse gas abatement potential is 0.91 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent gases from 2020 to 2050. In the Scenario 1—with 81 percent adoption of low-flow taps and showerheads—even with a net cost of US$1.5 billion, the lifetime operating savings are roughly US$477.9 billion due to water heating cost savings. The figures for Scenario 2 show 1.56 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent\xa0avoided along with US$765 billion in lifetime operating costs for only US$2.4 billion in net costs', 'Discussion \xa0\nGiven that there could be a tremendous increase in domestic water demand over the coming 30 years (demand is forecast to increase by 270 percent), the implementation of the low-flow fixtures solution appears very reasonable, especially as the cost of retrofitting existing taps/showers is not great. A co‐benefit of domestic water saving is a reduced reliance on overstretched freshwater supplies, reduced energy consumption, and reduced need for new water and energy infrastructure. Water and energy supply are two essential services that cross over in what is called the “water-energy nexus.”\n\n\n\n[1] The international dollar is a consistent currency used for comparisons across countries and years', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

45,Managed Grazing,"['Project Drawdown defines managed grazing as a set of practices that sequester carbon in grassland soils by adjusting stocking rates, timing, and intensity of grazing. This solution replaces conventional grazing on grasslands, including both pastures and rangelands', 'Livestock grazing covers more than\xa03.3 billion hectares, or 25 percent of the world’s land area, making it humanity’s largest land use (Asner et al., 2004). Poor grazing practices have contributed to land degradation and loss of soil carbon. However, there are managed grazing practices that can enhance net carbon sequestration and other modes of soil and vegetation quality on grazing lands via: a) controlled intensity and timing of grazing; b) enclosure of grassland to encourage resting; and/or c) other kinds of planned and adaptive grazing', 'Under managed grazing, emissions of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide continue, but are more than offset by sequestration, at least until soil carbon saturation is achieved. Project Drawdown takes the conservative assumption that emissions do not change with conversion from conventional to managed grazing', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area[1]\nTotal potential land for managed grazing is 1.2 billion hectares, consisting of nondegraded grassland.[2] Current adoption[3] of managed grazing is estimated at 71.6 million hectares.

This is the result of meta-analysis of 55 data points from 22 sources.

The Project\xa0Drawdown model’s calculations are thus in line with the available benchmarks', 'Limitations\nA key limitation was the lack of information on current adoption. More robust adoption data would improve the model results. Financial data are\xa0also rarely reported and are\xa0largely limited to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Financial results would benefit from robust data from other regions. Yield gain data is also very limited in this study', ""Conclusions\nManaged grazing is a solution that addresses the world's most widespread land use. It represents a net-sequestration system for producing livestock products. Even the most aggressive plant-based diet scenarios show significant need for livestock products in 2050. Thus, managed grazing is an essential supply-side food solution in any mitigation program"", '\n\n\n[1] Determining the total available land for a solution is a two-part process. The technical potential is based on the suitability of climate, soils, and slopes, and on degraded or nondegraded status. In the second stage, land is allocated using the Project Drawdown Agro-Ecological Zone model, based on priorities for each class of land. The total land allocated for each solution is capped at the solution’s maximum adoption in the Optimum Scenario. Thus, in most cases the total available land is less than the technical potential', '\n\n[2] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

46,Methane Digesters,"['Project Drawdown defines as large methane digesters, systems associated with agriculture, manure, and wastewater facilities that produce biogas to be used for electricity generation in dedicated biogas or combined heat and power plants. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Methane digesters have been installed throughout the world and at relatively high rates in China, the European Union, and Southeast Asia in the past 20 years.

Therefore, a few assumptions were considered to obtain future adoption: biogas represents approximately 20 percent of total electricity generation from bioenergy worldwide, and the feedstocks covered within this solution represent 70 percent of total biogas. Landfill methane accounts for the remaining 30 percent (AEBIOM, 2012; WBA, 2013)', 'Financial Modeling\nSeveral data points were analyzed to determine the average capital cost: it is recognized that costs can vary significantly by region, but exhaustive regional data was not available to calculate an average cost weighted by installation size. Available data points were mainly from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, reflecting the preponderance of present-day biogas installations in the European Union and United States. The financial inputs used in the model assume average installation costs of US$6,111 per kilowatt.[5] \xa0Due to the maturity of this technology, a learning rate of 2 percent was considered, similar to the one applied to conventional technologies such as coal and natural gas power.

However, at the moment, uncertainty about how factors such as low wind speeds, high levels of turbulence, noise, visual impact, and animal strikes influence the performance of micro wind turbines makes it hard to determine their true potential in this form', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand (terawatt-hours) supplied by the solution in 2018', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$', '\n\n[3] For example: LED lighting and high-efficiency heat pumps.']"
48,Microgrids,"['Project Drawdown defines microgrids as\xa0localized\xa0groupings of electricity sources and loads that\xa0normally\xa0operate connected\xa0to, and synchronously with, the traditional centralized power grid, but\xa0can\xa0disconnect and function autonomously\xa0as physical and/or economic conditions dictate. This solution replaces the conventional practice of powering buildings and communities with electricity from a\xa0centralized grid', 'The defining characteristics of a microgrid are its semi-autonomous capability and the ability to control its loads and supply locally. A typical microgrid could be constituted by distributed generation technologies such as wind, solar, hydropower, or biomass, together with energy storage units or backup generation and load management tools. By enabling the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, along with storage and demand management, microgrids can play a critical role in the advancement of a flexible and efficient electrical grid. In addition, the use of local sources of energy to serve local loads helps reduce energy loss in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the electricity delivery system', 'More than 1\xa0billion people—around 17 percent of the global population—still lack access to a centralized power grid (Greenpeace, 2015). In 2013, more than 95 percent of the people living\xa0without electricity were in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia countries, mainly living in rural areas (around 80 percent of the world total). At present, population growth is outpacing the efforts of electrification. The International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates that more than 50 percent of the rural and remote population currently without electricity would be best supplied by mini or microgrids (2014). Providing energy access to these people using low-carbon energy technologies is expected to bring many additional benefits, such as improved health, education, and employment. Microgrids also make economic sense in remote and island locations that have historically depended on imported diesel for electricity, in regions with an unreliable conventional grid, and for cellphone towers that rely extensively on expensive diesel-based power', 'For roughly 300 million unelectrified households globally, kerosene has been the dominant fuel source for lighting. Several studies indicate that the price paid by microgrid customers for electric lighting is far less than the price for lighting using kerosene and candles (Barefoot Power, 2009)', 'Methodology\nBecause the growth and emissions impacts for this solution are accounted for in the models of renewable energy sources and accompanying enabling technologies, including small hydropower, micro wind turbines, distributed solar photovoltaics, and biomass\xa0power paired with distributed energy storage, we do not directly model the growth and impact of microgrids. For higher-income countries, the benefits of microgrid systems fall under the grid flexibility solution, and also under the impacts of increased adoption of decentralized variable renewable energy sources', 'Discussion\nEquitable access to energy is a crucial prerequisite for sustainable development. Increasing demand for electricity globally is bound to test the limits of a centralized power system in the near future. An optimal combination of centralized and decentralized systems can capture both the strength of the central grid and the agility of state-of-the-art technological advancements in a decentralized infrastructure. Microgrids can help bridge this gap while making use of locally available energy resources', 'Microgrid infrastructure enables a transition to a decentralized power system that is more reliable, affordable, and sustainable. Investing in microgrids for emissions reduction is already profitable in many parts of the world that have historically depended on imported diesel for electricity. But there are also additional benefits, such as improved health due to reduced kerosene consumption in rural communities', 'Microgrid installations in grid-connected regions also offer several key advantages, including: optimized energy consumption through better matching of supply with demand; reduced environmental impact through integration of renewable energy sources; increased security of energy supply; provision of cost-efficient electricity infrastructure; and the ability to locally rank power supply for high-priority needs during times of disruption', 'In a world that increasingly depends\xa0on electricity for its very existence, losing access to the power supply due to outages or blackouts is a critical risk that cannot be overlooked. Microgrids, by virtue of being locally managed, are resilient against such disruptions in supply and have more control over the local demand.']"
49,Multistrata Agroforestry,"['Project Drawdown defines multistrata agroforestry as\xa0a perennial cropping system featuring multiple layers of trees and other perennial crops, with high biosequestration impacts. The system is characterized by having an overstory of taller trees\xa0and an understory of one or multiple layers of crops growing in some degree of shade. Their structure and function are similar to those of natural forests, though some are much more simplified. This solution replaces grazing on nondegraded tropical humid grassland', 'Carbon sequestration rates of multistrata agroforestry are very high, particularly for a food production system. The practice also offers impressive co-benefits, notably ecosystem services like habitat, erosion control, and water quality. In fact, tropical home gardens, a multistrata system, have been described as “the epitome of sustainability” (Kumar and Nair, 2004)', 'Climate mitigation literature often lumps multistrata agroforestry in an undifferentiated “agroforestry” category with silvopasture and tree intercropping. Its high sequestration rates and forestlike ecosystem services make multistrata agroforestry worthy of consideration on its own. Though their adoption potential is modest, multistrata systems can have a disproportionately high mitigation impact', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nThe maximum area allocated to multistrata agroforestry is 330 million hectares, and consists of nondegraded grassland.[1] Current adoption is allocated on nondegraded forest land', 'Current adoption[2] is estimated at 100 million hectares (Nair, 2012)', 'Adoption Scenarios\nSix custom adoption scenarios were generated to model i) projected adoption rates of 10 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent\xa0of the land allocated to multistrata agroforestry; and ii) early adoption rates, with 70 percent\xa0of all adoption occurring by 2030. These scenarios are not unreasonable in light of the Bonn Challenge and New York Declaration of Forests, which propose to complete all restoration by 2030.Impacts of increased adoption of multistrata agroforestry from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios.

A highly-cited study estimated sequestration of 4.0–8.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year for all tropical agroforestry by 2050 (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003). The combined impacts of Project Drawdown’s three agroforestry solutions (multistrata agroforestry,\xa0silvopasture, and tree intercropping) is 3.19–4.56 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year in 2050, though this includes some temperate silvopasture and tree intercropping', 'Limitations\nFew climate mitigation data break out multistrata systems as a subset of agroforestry. Access to such data would improve this study, as would additional financial data', 'Conclusions\nPerennial cropping solutions like multistrata agroforestry can offer the high sequestration rates of afforestation and forest restoration while providing food.

50,Net-Zero Buildings,"['Project Drawdown defines net-zero buildings as: new buildings that utilize high-efficiency building solutions and on-site renewable energy systems to consume zero energy from utility-scale sources and produce net zero carbon emissions on an annual basis. This solution replaces conventional building practices and energy consumption', '“Net zero” refers to new buildings which are either “net zero energy” or “net zero carbon.” Net zero energy buildings are energy-efficient and consume zero energy from utility-scale sources on an annual basis because all the power the building needs is generated through on-site renewable energy. Net zero carbon buildings produce net zero carbon emissions on an annual basis. The definition of zero carbon varies across countries and may include an element of carbon offsetting. For the purposes of this analysis, net zero buildings are considered as new net zero energy buildings', 'Methodology\nNet zero buildings encompasses several solutions in the Buildings and Energy Sectors that have been modeled individually by Project Drawdown. Net zero buildings can involve all Drawdown solutions modeled, including the installation of better insulation, high performance windows, more efficient lighting, heat pumps, efficient water heating, optimized building system controls, distributed renewable energy systems, etc.[1] Since these solutions were modeled separately, net zero buildings were not modeled independently in order to avoid double-counting', 'Results\nThe emissions and financial impacts of net zero buildings are included in individual solutions in order to avoid double-counting. For more information, see the Sector Summary: Buildings link below', 'In order to assess the overall potential of net zero buildings, however, estimates were made based on several future adoption cases derived from the American Institute of Architecture 2030 Challenge framework targets, LEED Platinum building adoptions as a proxy for net zero buildings, and New Building Institute (NBI) current adoption data and growth rates for net zero buildings projects. The potential emissions reduction impacts ranged from 5 to 32 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, depending on the adoption rate society chooses to implement. If net zero buildings adoption is projected based on using the NBI data, an estimated 9.7 percent of new buildings could be net zero by 2050, with a cumulative emissions reduction of 7.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent', 'Discussion\nThe building industry has the potential to have a large impact on drawing down greenhouse gas emissions. There are many different energy efficiency strategies to reduce the impact of buildings. In addition to this, on-site energy generation takes buildings a step further to reduce their impacts. The ideal solution combines both of these strategies with buildings generating as much renewable energy as they consume on an annual basis. This is the essential concept of net zero buildings. In this way, net zero buildings combine many other Drawdown solutions into one elegant concept for humans to strive towards', 'In practice, net zero buildings help drive design teams and owners to design and make investments in energy conservation measures and on-site energy generation. The projections of performance are based on a number of factors that could change significantly based on the decisions made by society. For example, if energy efficiency and production along with polluting greenhouse gases were properly priced, the adoption rate of net zero buildings would be much higher. It is plausible that most new buildings could achieve net zero status now if society priced the driving factors around them properly. \xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n[1] Net zero buildings comprise some undefined combination of solutions relevant to the particular characteristics of the building in question in order to achieve net zero status.']"
51,Nuclear Power,"['Project Drawdown defines nuclear power as the electricity generation from nuclear fission in the form of uranium-235 as used in pressurized water reactors, a type of light-water reactor using low-enriched uranium fuel. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Commercialized civil nuclear energy captures the energy released by the splitting of atoms in radioactive elements. This energy can be extremely powerful and resource-efficient: 1 kilogram of uranium-235 contains 2–3 million times the energy equivalent of 1 kilogram of oil or coal. During nuclear fission in the reactor core, heat is produced; this heat is used to boil water into steam; the steam then turns turbine blades that drive generators to make electricity', 'Methodology\nThis analysis models the adoption of nuclear fission as used in pressurized water reactors, a type of light-water reactor using low-enriched uranium fuel, the current most prevalent form of nuclear energy. Advanced reactors such as thorium-based reactors, gas-cooled reactors, pebble bed reactors, and other technologies in the pre-commercialization phases are out of the scope of this research', 'Total Addressable Market[1]\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration.

52,Nutrient Management,"['Project Drawdown defines nutrient management as fertilizer application practices that use right source, right rate, right time and right placement principles. These principles are important for both countries where fertilizer consumption is high and nitrogen use efficiency low (e.g., United States, China) as well as in countries where substantial increases in nutrient inputs on cropland is needed (Sub-Saharan Africa).Nitrogen fertilizers have greatly increased agricultural production over the past century. But the application of fertilizers to soil can lead to emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, as fertilizer that is not used by plants is utilized by denitrifiying bacteria that release nitrous oxide as a metabolic byproduct. Fertilizer is routinely over-applied in many countries. Furthermore, since the production of fertilizer is an energy-intensive process that produces high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, reducing fertilizer application will also have the effect of abating emissions associated with its production', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area[1]\nTotal available land for nutrient management is 1,411 million hectares (essentially all annual and perennial cropland).[2] Current adoption[3] is estimated at 139.1 million hectares.

Wave energy converters are devices which convert the kinetic motion of ocean waves into electricity. Tidal stream energy can be tapped by using devices which act as underwater wind turbines, converting the flow of tidal currents into electricity. Tidal plants are large, utility-scale systems which direct the flow of tides through turbines to generate electricity, akin to hydropower electricity generation', 'Of the many types of renewable energy, wave and tidal energy is arguably the most predictable. While the resource is spread out globally, there are only a few locations where wave and tidal energy can be harnessed commercially. The technologies used to convert marine energy to electricity are quite different.

It is assumed that all sequestered carbon is re-emitted at the end of an orchard or plantation’s useful life, which here is set at 37.5 years', 'The weighted average yield of perennial staple crops is 2.4 times greater than that of annual staples, based on analysis of data from seven\xa0perennials and 15 annuals (FAOSS)', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs are US$1298.4 per hectare, based on meta-analysis of 12 data points from six\xa0sources.[5] For all grazing solutions it is assumed that there is no conventional first cost\xa0because\xa0agriculture is already in place on the land. Net profit per hectare is calculated at US$1025.98 per year for the solution (based on meta-analysis of 22 data points from 13 sources), compared with\xa0US$154.12 per year for the conventional practice (based on 20 data points from 15 sources).[6] Annual operational cost per hectare is calculated at US$749.28 for the solution (based on meta-analysis of 19 data points from 12 sources), compared with\xa0US$328.42 for the conventional practice (based on nine\xa0data points from seven\xa0sources).[7]\nIntegration[8]\nProject Drawdown’s Agro-Ecological Zone model allocates current and projected adoption of solutions to the planet’s forest, grassland, rainfed cropland, and irrigated cropland areas. Adoption of perennial staple crops was the second-highest priority for degraded grassland and the sixth-highest for degraded cropland', 'Results\nTotal adoption in the Scenario 1 is 110.9 million hectares in 2050, representing 42.3 percent of the total suitable land. Of this, 60.9 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The emissions impact of this scenario is 15.45 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. Net cost is US$83.1 billion and lifetime operational cost is US$847.9 billion. Lifetime saving in net profit is US$1.4 trillion', 'Total adoption in the Scenario 2 is 190.8 million hectares in 2050, representing 63.4 percent of the total suitable land. Of this, 140.8 million hectares are adopted from 2020 to 2050. The impact of this scenario is 31.26 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050.

Lifetime saving in net profit is US$3.3 trillion', ""Discussion\nBenchmarks\nBenchmarks for this solution are unavailable, and mitigation benchmarks for tree crops of any kind are rare. This suggests a need for a new area of research. Projections for tree plantation can be used as a rough comparison. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates an impact of 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030 from afforestation, given a carbon dioxide price of US$100 per ton (Metz, 2007). The perennial staple crops model shows 0.46–0.83 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030, much lower. When combined with Project Drawdown's bamboo production and tree plantation solutions, however, emissions reductions increase to 1.33–2.45 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year by 2030"", 'Limitations\nAdditional data on financials, sequestration rates, and yields would improve this study. The potential adoption area could be increased to include arid regions, as many perennial staple crops like mesquite are suited to arid conditions', 'Conclusions\nPerennial cropping solutions such as\xa0multistrata agroforestry and perennial staple crops can offer the high sequestration rates of afforestation and forest restoration while providing food. These somewhat neglected “edible afforestation”\xa0solutions are worthy of a place at the center of land-based mitigation efforts. It should also be noted that there are staple trees for cold climates, though their yields are not yet competitive with annual crops. Project Drawdown hopes to inspire further research and widespread adoption of this promising solution', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

The technical potential is based on the suitability of climate, soils, and slopes, and on degraded or nondegraded status. In the second stage, land is allocated using the Project Drawdown Agro-Ecological Zone model, based on priorities for each class of land. The total land allocated for each solution is capped at the solution’s maximum adoption in the Optimum Scenario. Thus, in most cases the total available land is less than the technical potential', '\n\n[3] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$', '\n\n[4] Tropical staple trees are not as labor-efficient as annual crops, in a mechanized context.

59,Plant-Rich Diets,"['Project Drawdown defines a plant-rich diet as the individual dietary choice to 1) maintain a 2250-calorie-per-day nutritional regime; 2) meet daily protein requirements while decreasing meat consumption in favor of plant-based food items; and 3) purchase locally produced food when available. This solution replaces projected regional dietary trends', 'Plant-rich diets hold enormous potential for climate change mitigation if adopted on a global scale, but anyone wishing to make global diets more sustainable will be working against established dietary trends. Global dietary preferences—in particular, those related to meat, fish, and dairy products—will continue to be a key driver of both agricultural and land use–related emissions. A plant-rich diet can be readily adopted even with small behavioral changes that can have a significant effect globally. In terms of cost, the solution appears to yield significant savings at the individual level, and indirectly at the national level through lower health-care costs. Moreover, the burden of change seems highly equitable and implementable, because developing nations already consume fewer calories and do not need to shift their diets much, whereas developed nations need to address issues such as obesity', 'Methodology\nTo evaluate the impact of a plant-rich diet, an independent model was created outside Project Drawdown’s core model framework to project food consumption and waste from 2020 to 2050. This was required due to the complexity of estimating country- and regional-scale food consumption and waste trends based on reported commodity types along the supply chain', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe global market for a plant-rich diet is defined as the total demand for food\xa0based on estimated kilocalories supplied per year for consumption by the world’s population. The baseline food consumption is projected for all countries up to 2060 in kilocalories per capita per year, using data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 2013.[1] Future consumption is forecasted using growth factors from Alexandratos et al. (2012), which reflect projected dietary changes.[2]\nAdoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of plant-rich diets from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario in which\xa0the food demand reflects future “business-as-usual” dietary changes based on projected regional growth factors for available food categories (Alexandratos et al., 2012).[3]\nThe adoption of a plant-rich diet assumes the following criteria are met:\n\nAdopting an individual daily nutritional regime of 2250 kilocalories per day;\nConsuming reduced quantities of meat-based protein (particularly red meat, which is constrained to 57 grams per day);[4]\nPurchasing locally produced food when possible (a 5 percent localization factor is applied globally)', '\nAdoption scenarios in this model grow linearly over time starting from the base year of 2014, and are considered “complete” in 2050. Linear growth trends were chosen because of the lack of country or regional data; additional behavioral research at more granular scales can reveal more representative adoption estimates', 'For plant-rich diet, the following scenarios were considered:\n\nScenario 1: This scenario assumes that 50 percent of the global population will adopt a plant-rich diet by 2050', 'Scenario 2: In this scenario, adoption will reach 75 percent of the global population by 2050', '\nEmissions Model\nTo estimate emissions, commodity-specific carbon dioxide-equivalent per-calorie values were drawn from several sources (see Audsley et al., 2010; Heller and Keoleian, 2014; Hoolohan et al., 2013; Tilman and Clark, 2014; Vieux et al., 2012) to determine minimum, average, and maximum estimated emissions factors per commodity. The emissions factors were multiplied by the baseline annual food demand by country and commodity to get the carbon dioxide-equivalent values for food items over time. Emissions estimates were aggregated by commodity types[5] and regions classified by the FAO (2011), and are aligned with regions used by Project Drawdown', 'Emissions reductions are calculated based on the incremental adoption of plant-rich diets. This figure is subtracted from the emissions associated with the Reference Scenario, and resulting net emissions reductions are aggregated to represent the total global reduction from avoided agricultural production', 'Integration\nProject Drawdown calculates the total change in food demand by weight (in million metric tons) by commodity type. It is assumed that reduced demand in countries with consumption trends higher than 2250 kilocalories per capita per day can be diverted to feed current and future undernourished populations. Diverted tonnage of food is used as an input in the Project Drawdown Integrated Yield Model, which combines all agricultural production models to determine the required yield to meet the estimated food and bio-based product demand on an annual basis. Results from all demand-side solutions (i.e., reduced food waste and plant-rich diet)\xa0determine the need for land conversion to cropland and grassland in order to meet future food demand. Emissions reductions associated with land conversion are applied to both reduced food waste and plant-rich diet according to the proportion of their contribution to diverted food supply', 'Results\nBetween 2020 and 2050, Scenario 1 projects the total cumulative emissions reduction from adopting a plant-rich diet to be 65.02 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent gases: 43.01 gigatons due to diverted agricultural production, 21.78 gigatons from avoided land conversion, and 0.23 gigatons from sequestration from ecosystem protection', 'Scenario 2 avoids emissions by a total of 91.72 gigatons: 68.32 gigatons due to diverted agricultural production, 23.16 gigatons from avoided land conversion, and 0.24 gigatons from sequestration from ecosystem protection', 'Discussion\nThe reality of high per-capita meat consumption in high-income countries, paired with global diets that are forecasted to look increasingly Western, creates one of the most fundamental challenges of plant-rich diet adoption. How can we reduce livestock production in the face of high and rapidly increasing demand? Achieving some dietary change is reasonable, but more dramatic changes will be difficult to implement globally', 'Scaling plant-rich diets globally is a challenge of communication and education as much as it is one of policy. Among the most fundamental research findings on this topic is that healthier diets tend to also be low-emission diets (Bajželj et al., 2014; Tilman and Clark, 2014; Stehfest et al., 2009). While plant-rich diets are not necessarily the lowest-emission diets, they represent a significant improvement over current dietary practices, particularly those in countries like the USA and Australia where meat (and especially beef) consumption is high. This overlap in desirable outcomes (healthier population, lower emissions) is a powerful communication and policy tool, particularly given that individuals are more likely to respond favorably to messaging that affects their health than they are to messaging relevant to their environmental impact', '\n\n\n[1] www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data\n\n\n[2] The projected dietary changes show significant impacts for countries such as\xa0India and China, whose populations are expected to demand more carbon-intensive foods over the next 30 years', '\n\n[3] The Reference Scenario is equivalent to the total addressable market for food demand', '\n\n[4] The caloric breakdown of plant-rich diet comes from Bajželj et al. (2014). This breakdown takes projected regional data and optimizes it according to a number of nutritional studies to comprise a “healthy” diet', '\n\n[5] Commodity types include: cereals, roots and tubers, oilseeds and pulses, fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and seafood, and milk.']"
60,Public Transit,"['Project Drawdown defines the public transit solution as the increased usage of mass transit or public transport to get around cities. This solution replaces the use of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars', 'Public transit \xa0is a collection of different urban passenger transport modes (e.g., metro, bus, tram, ferries) that\xa0can facilitate the mobility of large numbers of people. It has long been a structural part of urban environments worldwide, and while its market share has decreased through the second half of the 20th century, it remains the only viable alternative to travel by private car on many occasions. The population of urban areas is expected to grow from 2020 to 2050, and public transit can claim an important share of the new travel demand. The increased usage of public transportation reduces the need to drive cars as a form of urban mobility', 'Methodology\nUsing information from studies and reports conducted by major international institutions, several possible outcomes of various aggressive adoption scenarios were examined', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for public transit is defined as the total urban mobility, in passenger-kilometers, projected by institutions such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), and collaborative work between the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy and the University of California–Davis (ITDP/UCD). Current global adoption[1] of public transit, excluding nonmotorized trips, is 34 percent of the market, boosted mainly by high adoption rates in low-income countries where car ownership is lower. In high-income areas such as\xa0Europe and Japan, public transit already has significant and rising adoption; still, conventional ICE vehicles own the largest part of the market share in Europe and North America, as well as in other developed regions. Meanwhile, the adoption of public transit \xa0in Asia and Africa is threatened by a combination of economic growth and poor transit infrastructure, partly leading to a low business-as-usual projection of global public transit adoption in 2050 as urban mobility expands rapidly through the use of other modes especially private cars', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of public transit \xa0from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. They\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s usage follows a case close to business as usual (the IEA Reference Technology Scenario,\xa0RTS).[2] Future high growth projections of public transit \xa0are aligned with the IEA and ITDP/UCD', '\nScenario 1: Estimates of future growth were based on projections of public transit \xa0adoption from the 2016 IEA 2°C Scenario, where adoption reaches 22 percent in 2050', 'Scenario 2: Projections were aligned with the ITDP/UCD 2014 Global High Shift Scenario, where adoption reaches 35 percent in 2050', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions calculations capture electricity, fuel use, black carbon, and indirect emissions for public transit, all weighted according to the public transit mode. Electricity and fuel data were obtained from ITDP/UCD and other sources. Car emissions are based on fuel use and black carbon alone. Fuel economy data is taken from multiple sources and represents the global car fleet', 'Financial Model\nThe financial analysis is conducted from the perspective of the user, rather than public transit \xa0operators, municipalities, or society as a whole. This is valuable so that those making decisions about whether to travel by public transit \xa0or by conventional vehicles have a better idea of the financial and emissions aspects of that decision. Public transit \xa0first costs have been excluded from this model to prevent misinterpretation of the cost of implementation, but car first costs have been included as a fixed operating cost of depreciation. By contrasting the use of public transit \xa0with internal combustion engine vehicles, the depreciated costs of owning and using a car are compared with\xa0the cost of purchasing a public transit \xa0ticket. The financial evaluation is thus based on the net operating costs: the weighted average ticket price of public transit \xa0options by region,[3] compared with\xa0the fixed operating costs (i.e.,\xa0insurance and depreciation), fuel costs, and other variable operating costs\xa0of car ownership (e.g., maintenance)', 'To ensure that this model was well integrated with other Project Drawdown models, we used the common market and car inputs across all relevant solutions. Adoption was also restricted so as to not exceed the total mobility demand represented by the total addressable market', 'Results\nScenario 1 results in an emissions reduction of 7.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases and over US$2 trillion[4] in lifetime operations savings, with adoption going to 22 percent in 2050. In the Scenario 2, emission reductions could reach as high as 23 gigatons', 'Discussion\nWhen combined with other technologies and approaches such as electric/hybrid engines, clean energy production, vehicle automation, and car sharing, the impact of public transit \xa0can increase significantly. Without public transit–focused investments and policy, it is likely that much of the projected growth in urban mobility would be taken up by private cars, and even if exciting developments such as\xa0electric, autonomous, shared-car fleets become widespread, public transit would be needed on high-demand routes. There therefore needs to be a significant effort to ensure that public transit systems are attractive means of mobility for the increasingly urbanized world. We excluded public transit\xa0investment costs for governments, but we also excluded additional benefits of increased public transit \xa0usage such as reduced congestion from private vehicles\xa0and potentially more city space reclaimed from parking lots that are not required. It is unlikely that adding these elements would alter the basic conclusion that public transit \xa0is a key part of reducing urban transport emissions', '\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018. This study uses 2014 as the base year', '\n\n[2] This assumption is contrary to the standard Project Drawdown Reference Scenario, which assumes that growth occurs in relation to the overall growth of the market, with the percent adoption remaining fixed at current year levels. Given current trends, this assumption is considered to be too optimistic without strong policy in countries such as China and India where growth in conventional car ownership is on the rise', '\n\n[3] Ticket data came from http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/cost-of-public-transportation-around-the-world.html, and have\xa0been averaged by Drawdown region', '\n\n[4] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$.']"
61,Recycled Paper,"['Project Drawdown defines recycled paper as: the increased recovery and reprocessing of used paper into paper products. This solution replaces the use of virgin paper feedstocks', 'Recycled paper is a form of paper that is made, at least in part, of paper, fiber, or pulp that has been reprocessed after usage, disposal, and recovery. Conventional, or virgin, paper is produced through chemical or mechanical processes that utilize virgin tree pulp fibers. Processing recycled paper content involves processes such as sorting, shredding, hydropulping, and deinking, whereas conventional paper involves distinct steps such as harvesting, debarking, chipping, and mechanical or chemical pulping. Both production processes use energy and emit greenhouse gases as a result, but starting with a recovered paper feedstock uses less energy and results in lower greenhouse gas emissions. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\nMethodology\nTo arrive at the results for mitigation impact and financial considerations for recycled paper, Project Drawdown first needed to calculate a forecast for total paper production from 2014 to 2050 (in million metric tons), then determine the current adoption[1] of recycled paper, forecast future adoption scenarios of recycled paper for that period, derive an emissions mitigation value per million metric tons of recycled paper produced, and calculate the emissions mitigated and costs in comparison with a Reference Scenario that keeps adoption of recycled paper at its current percentage of global paper adoption', ""Total Addressable Market[2]\nThe total addressable market for paper was measured using data from industry and academic research. The primary data source is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and some regions’ projected markets are based on statistical consulting company RISI, Inc.'s paper production projections through 2030, and McKinsey & Co (2013). RISI’s statistics were not always aligned with FAO’s data; thus, other sources, including the Confederation of European Paper Industry (CEPI), Buongiorno’s Global Forest Projection Models, and more were used and averaged. The annual growth/decline rates of each region were extrapolated through to 2050"", 'The current global recycled paper production rate is around 55 percent, with Western Europe leading with nearly 75 percent\xa0(primarily due to established infrastructure in Scandinavian countries) and India, Eastern Europe, China, and other Asian and Middle Eastern regions trailing (Buongiorno et al. 2003)', 'Adoption Scenarios[3]\nCustom adoption scenarios for recycled paper were created by taking regional and global data prognostications as current growth rates for recycling. Western Europe’s recovery rate of 75% is considered to the feasible maximum of paper recycling currently.\xa0\nImpacts of increased adoption of industrial recycling from 2020-2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios, which were assessed in comparison to the\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario mentioned above', '\nScenario 1: Based on the low-growth-trend best fit analysis of the custom adoption scenarios, the production of 621 million metric tons of recycled paper is assumed in 2050, which is 69% of the market. The low was chosen due to the highly uncertain nature of the paper market beyond 2030, especially in emerging markets', 'Scenario 2: Here, adoption is accelerated after 2020 to the high-growth-trend best fit line and then capped at 74% of the market, or 684 million metric tons of recycled paper. A lower market for recycled paper is also chosen to reflect the integrated waste generation metrics from an integrated measure of global waste and its composition, including all Drawdown solutions', '\nEmissions Model\nClimate inputs analyzed included direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions for recycled and conventional paper products. The unit of measure was metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent produced per metric ton of paper produced. Data from outside North America, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and parts of Europe was not available for emissions calculation. Emissions due to paper manufacturing process are analyzed as direct emissions. Emissions from all other life cycle stages of virgin and recycled paper production are analyzed as indirect emissions', 'Life cycle analyses trace the amount of emissions from a product’s ‘cradle to grave’. Emissions could be attributed to the initial timber harvest, or to the processing, transportation, consumption, and disposal stages. Some sources attempted to trace these emissions through every process, while others only measured emissions at the manufacturing stage, i.e. when mills receive pulp and then process it to produce recycled or virgin paper. Modeling emissions associated with paper and paper-making, such as deforestation or carbon sequestered as a result of recycled paper, was outside the scope of the analysis', 'Financial Model\nFinancial research focused on the first costs of purchasing paper by the consumer. In this case, the agent considered was a US-based paper consumer, and the first costs were those that an individual would face when purchasing recycled rather than conventional paper products. Due to the variety of paper products and the differences in grades and qualities, several assumptions had to be made in order to conduct a financial analysis. Facing a lack of available industry data, research was conducted via a market spot-check price comparison. A single type of paper – uncoated office/copy paper – was considered as an appropriate primary price marker. Different types of paper were added to proportionally reflect a more accurate price', 'Results\nThe total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions that can be achieved from 2020-2050 in the Scenario 1 are 1.1 gigatons, with a marginal first cost of $456 billion.[4] The Scenario 2s shows a mitigation of 1.95 gigatons from 2020-2050', 'Discussion\nRecycled paper directly emits, on average, 0.15 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent less per metric ton produced than virgin paper; thus, it is a climate reduction solution to be considered. Global paper production and consumption is predicted to rise globally, especially in emerging economies where paper and packaging is in high demand. However, several developed economies are gradually reducing their paper production and consumption rates. This is due to decreasing stocks of virgin source materials, as well as decreased demand due to the substitution of electronic media, especially in its role of replacing newsprint. The growth of electronic media will play a very important part in the paper industry’s growth or decline in the future. The potential for recycled paper as a material reduction solution depends on the growth of the paper market globally, as well as on a change in consumer preferences and a decrease in cost', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

62,Recycling,"['Project Drawdown defines recycling as\xa0the increased recovery of recyclable materials, not including paper nor organic materials, from the industrial and residential sectors of the economy. This solution replaces the disposal of recyclable materials in landfills', 'Recovering and recycling waste materials for use in new products reduces the amount of materials manufactured from virgin sources, produces less greenhouse gas emissions, and reduces the environmental burden created if the waste is disposed in overcrowded landfills. Waste considered in this solution is postconsumer waste, measured at waste collection centers.[1] Recyclable waste types considered for this solution are metals, plastic, glass, and other.[2] Waste that is recyclable makes up around 37 percent\xa0of total municipal solid waste generated globally', 'Methodology\nMunicipal solid waste is defined differently by governments, organizations, and researchers; for this solution, all sources include both household and commercial waste in aggregate values reported. Because the fraction of total waste allocated to households and commercial or industrial waste generators is not often reported, it is assumed that 50 percent\xa0of recyclable waste is derived from the industrial sector (US EPA, 1998)', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for recyclable waste was calculated using a composite of forecasts, including a linear interpolation of World Bank data from 2010 to 2025, an extrapolation to extend those projections to 2050, and a per capita extrapolation using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).[3] It is estimated that by 2050, global organic waste will be approximately 1459 million metric tons. Current adoption[4] of both household and commercial recycling in\xa02014 was estimated at 27 percent of recyclable waste (see Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012)', 'Adoption Scenarios\nDue to the lack of reliable future projections of the growth of recycling, three custom adoption estimates were developed based on increasingly ambitious recycling rates per region.[5] In the first estimate, all 2050 non-OECD regional rates are set to the 2014 OECD recycling rate of approximately 57 percent. In the second estimate, non-OECD countries’ recycling target rate for 2050 is set to the current Austrian recycling rate of 63 percent. In the third estimate, recycling rates for non-OECD countries, recycling rates in 2050 are set to correspond with the current best recycling rate of the country in the corresponding region. For example, Asia (sans Japan) region’s recycling rate target is set to 61 percent, which is Singapore’s recycling rate in 2015. From these estimations, adoption boundaries were created from which the Project Scenario 2s were derived', 'Impacts of increased adoption of household recycling from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: In this scenario it is assumed that recycling will increase from present rates to 65 percent\xa0of the market,[6] amounting to 941 million metric tons of recycled material in 2050 total', 'Scenario 2: In this scenario, complete optimization of source separation and collection processes as well as aggressive zero waste policy adoption are assumed. The amount of total recycled waste in 2050 is 984 million metric tons', '\nFinancial Model\nFinancial results were created by comparing the costs of creating and operating material recovery facilities or mechanical-biological treatment facilities to creating and operating sanitary landfills for an equivalent volume of recyclable waste. The marginal first cost is US$10 billion. When revenues from recovered materials are included in comparison to the costs of virgin materials, however, operating recycling facilities costs less than operating landfills and sourcing virgin material feedstocks for industry.\xa0\nIntegration\nFor integration into the Materials Sector, Project Drawdown first considers the reduction in recyclable waste due to the increased adoption of the assumed compostable fraction of bioplastic.\xa0 The recyclable fraction of waste decreases year to year as the fraction of recyclable plastic used by humanity decreases, so that as the adoption scenarios become optimized the overall adoption of household recycling decreases yet the adoption percentage increases. \xa0\nResults\nIn Scenario 1, Project Drawdown found a potential 5.5 gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over 2020–2050, corresponding to a 65 percent\xa0adoption of recycling of recyclable waste. This came with a net implementation cost of US$10 billion but a net operational savings over the same period of US$142 billion.\xa0 For Scenario 2, the emissions avoided amount to 6.02 gigatons with a 68 percent\xa0adoption', 'Discussion\nHousehold and industrial recycling are keystone elements of a circular economy that provides industry with feedstocks to produce needed goods with fewer emissions. Recycling also generates unmeasured benefits by extending the life of sanitary landfills and creating economic opportunity and activity in material recovery and reprocessing', 'Limitations\nThe state of currently operating landfills and material recovery facilities could not be easily determined within the scope of this study. Because of the limitations to establish how much waste can be landfilled in currently operating landfills and how much of the capacity of currently operating material recovery facilities is not exploited to its full potential, first costs of such facilities are calculated for installing completely new facilities. Similar limitations of the study have been identified with establishing first costs of introducing new solid waste collection systems by municipalities, and the unused capacity of existing ones.\xa0 Additionally, much of the complexity of recycling ceramics, rubber, textiles and e-waste have been oversimplified with the approach taken.\xa0 Finally, it is also likely the development in the technologies of material recycling, product recycling and end-of-pipe technologies such as waste identification and sorting technologies, waste disassembly and shredding technologies, and material recovery technologies will have positive impacts on lowering first costs and operating costs of recycling', '\n\n\n[1] Pre-consumer waste is found in far smaller amounts: Only 10 percent\xa0of total postconsumer waste generated by households, residential, commercial, and institutional subjects. Pre-consumer waste is also almost 100 percent\xa0recyclable on-site. The amount of pre-consumer waste that is lost from the material cycle is hence negligible (EU Joint Center 2002)', '\n\n[2] Note that recycled paper\xa0is excluded and assessed by another Project Drawdown solution', '\n\n[3] Using UN 2015 median urban population forecast', '\n\n[4] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

63,Reduced Food Waste,"['Project Drawdown defines reduced food waste as\xa0minimizing food loss and wastage from all stages of production, distribution, retail, and consumption. This solution replaces current reported trends in food waste by region', 'Estimates suggest that 30–40 percent of all food produced worldwide is wasted across the supply chain (Smith, P. et al., 2014). When food is wasted, all the energy, resources, and money that went into producing, processing, packaging, and transporting it are wasted too. The further down the supply chain the food gets before it is thrown out, the more resources are wasted to get it to that stage. If measures are taken to reduce food waste by improving storage and transport systems, generating public awareness, and changing consumer behavior, this solution could lead to substantial reductions in waste and carbon emissions', 'Methodology\nTo evaluate the impact of reduced food waste, an independent model was created outside Drawdown’s core model framework to project food consumption and waste from 2020 to 2050. This was required due to the complexity of estimating country- and regional-scale food consumption and waste trends based on reported commodity types along the supply chain', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe global market for reduced food waste is defined as the total demand for food, based on estimated kilocalories supplied per year for consumption by the world’s population. The baseline food consumption is projected for all countries up to 2060 in kilocalories per capita per year, using data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the year 2013.[1] Future consumption is forecasted using growth factors from Alexandratos et al. (2012), which reflect projected dietary changes.[2]\nTotal food loss and wastage is calculated according to regional estimates of waste generated at each supply chain stage[3] (FAO, 2011), applied to aggregated country-level food demand by commodity type. Current adoption[4] of reduced food waste is considered to be 0\xa0percent', 'Adoption Scenarios[5]\nImpacts of increased adoption of reduced food waste from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on three growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share is fixed at the current levels', 'Adoption scenarios in this model grow linearly over time starting from the base year of 2014, and are considered complete\xa0in 2050. Linear growth trends were chosen because of the lack of country or regional data; additional behavioral research at more granular scales can reveal more representative adoption estimates', 'For reduced food waste, three scenarios were developed:\n\nScenario 1: This scenario assumes that a 50 percent reduction in total global food loss and wastage will be achieved by 2050', 'Scenario 2: In this scenario, a 75 percent reduction in total global food loss and wastage by 2050 is modeled', '\nEmissions Model\nTo estimate emissions, commodity-specific carbon dioxide-equivalent per-calorie values were drawn from several sources (see Audsley et al., 2010; Heller and Keoleian, 2014; Hoolohan et al., 2013; Tilman and Clark, 2014; Vieux et al., 2012) to determine minimum, average, and maximum estimated emissions factors per commodity. The emissions factors were multiplied by the baseline annual food demand by country and commodity to get the carbon dioxide-equivalent values for food items over time. Emissions estimates were aggregated by commodity types[5] and regions classified by the FAO (2011), and are aligned with regions used by Project Drawdown', 'FAO regional estimates of food loss and wastage by commodity types across the supply chain stages were applied to aggregated emissions values associated with regional food demand. Emissions reductions were calculated based on the incremental adoption of reduced food waste, which was applied across all stages of the supply chain. Resulting emissions reductions were aggregated to represent the total global reduction from avoided agricultural production', 'Integration\nProject Drawdown calculated the total reduction in food loss and wastage by weight (in million metric tons) by commodity type. It was assumed that reduced loss and wastage can be diverted to feed current and future undernourished populations. Diverted tonnage of food was used as an input in the Project Drawdown Integrated Yield Model, which combines all agricultural production models to determine the required yield to meet the estimated food and bio-based product demand on an annual basis. Results from all demand-side solutions, i.e., reduced food waste and plant-rich diet, determine the need for land conversion to cropland and grassland in order to meet future food demand. Emissions reductions associated with land conversion were applied to both reduced food waste and plant-rich diet according to the proportion of their contribution to diverted food supply', 'In addition, the results of reduced food waste were applied to solution models in the Materials Sector that utilize organic municipal solid waste', 'Results\nBetween 2020 and 2050, Scenario 1 projects the reduction of 90.70 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions: 13.57\xa0gigatons due to diverted agricultural production, 76.33 gigatons from avoided land conversion, and 0.80 gigatons from ecosystem protection', 'Scenario 2 projects the reduction of 101.71 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions: 25.97 gigatons due to diverted agricultural production, 74.96 gigatons from avoided land conversion, and 0.78 gigatons from sequestration from ecosystem protection', 'Discussion\nFood loss and waste has many negative economic and environmental impacts. The global economic, environmental, and social cost of food wastage is estimated at US$2.6 trillion, which is nearly equal to the GDP of France (FAO, 2014). Food waste generates unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and wastes both water and land, negatively impacting natural ecosystems', 'Reducing food loss and waste can also help close the over 60 percent gap between food available today and food needed in 2050, thereby working toward eliminating hunger. Although solutions at consumer level are difficult to implement and hard to measure, they must be pursued at regions with high levels of consumer food waste. Food loss and waste measurement tools must be developed to standardize the measurement and reporting. Food waste reduction targets should be set not only at country levels, but also broken down to corporate, supplier, and consumer levels. Incentives for waste reduction should be designed and provided to influence behavior change. Reducing food waste is a big physical problem. But it has widespread benefits for the economy, the environment, society, and human health.\xa0\nNote: August 2021 corrections appear in boldface', '\n\n\n[1] http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data\n\n\n[2] The projected dietary changes show significant impacts for countries like India and China, whose populations are expected to demand more carbon-intensive foods over the next 30 years', '\n\n[3] Supply chain stages are defined as: agricultural production, postharvest handling and storage, processing, packaging, distribution, and consumption', '\n\n[4] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

64,Refrigerant Management,"['Project Drawdown defines refrigerant management as\xa0controlling leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances through better management practices and recovery, recycling, and destruction of refrigerants at the end of life. This solution replaces conventional refrigerant management practices', 'Refrigerants are used as working fluid in commercial refrigeration systems;\xa0in household appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators;\xa0in refrigerated containers used for carrying perishable goods;\xa0in\xa0air conditioning systems onboard cars, trains, aircraft, and ships;\xa0in industrial cooling systems; and more. There are various classes of refrigerants.[1] Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone-depleting substances and have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are also being phased out. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which do not deplete the ozone, emerged as an alternative to HCFCs and have grown to extensive use. All refrigerants have a high global warming potential, and their release into the environment contributes to climate change. Considering the large impact which the release of refrigerants has on global warming, world leaders agreed to phase out HFCs and replace them with natural refrigerants with much less warming potential under the Kigali Accord in October\xa02016. Refrigerants are emitted into the environment during the production process, from refrigerant banks[2] due to leakages, and during end-of-life disposal of appliances', 'Methodology\nMeasuring the refrigerant management solution requires\xa0generating a total addressable market forecast of the refrigerant gas emissions for the period 2020–2050 (in kilotons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per year), forecasting an adoption of management measures and the resulting decreased emissions from those measures for each year from 2020 to 2050, and then comparing the difference in emissions from the total market and the adoption scenarios.\xa0\nRefrigerant management can be undertaken in five main ways:\n\nlower\xa0the demand/use of appliances and thereby production of refrigerants\nreplace\xa0refrigerants with low-warming HFCs/new cooling agents/non-HFC substances\nincrease the refrigeration efficiency in appliances, thereby lowering the use of refrigerants\ncontrol leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances by good management practices\nensure\xa0recovery, reclaiming/recycling, and destruction of refrigerants at end of life', '\nThis drawdown solution models the lasts two options', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe model uses available projections for the size of refrigerant banks after considering the adoption of alternative refrigerants (another drawdown solution), which reduce the size of HFC banks.\xa0It then estimates the leakages from these banks using historical leakage rates for various subsectors such as commercial, industrial, domestic, and stationary air conditioning\xa0systems. This is the total addressable market', 'Adoption of good practices to control leakages is modeled as a part of the solution. The solution also models the accompanying costs from the application of these measures. Additionally, the solution considers the destruction of refrigerants at end of life: Some of the refrigerants are recovered and destroyed at this point. The current quantity of refrigerants that\xa0are recovered and destroyed is estimated by using historical data on equipment retirement rates, recovery efficiency, and destruction efficiency. For 2014, this value is estimated to be around 30 kilotons of refrigerant, which is approximately 3.4 percent of the total quantity emitted. This is the current adoption.[3]\nThis solution models the potential of capturing a higher portion of this refrigerant stream. Estimates of refrigerant banks in the future are used to calculate the end-of-life banks based on the expected lifetime of the equipment. Thereafter, higher recovery efficiencies are assumed based on the technical feasibility of recovery from various subsectors. Assumptions regarding\xa0increased destruction efficiencies are then used to estimate the refrigerant that\xa0can be destroyed in the future along with cost implications. The two parts of the solution are then combined to calculate the total impact', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of refrigerant management from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on three growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '[Office1]\xa0Emissions Model\nIn the conventional case, direct emissions from refrigerants that\xa0leak during the lifetime and at end of life contribute to global warming. These depend\xa0on the quantity of refrigerants\xa0emitted into the environment and their respective global warming potential. For the refrigerant management solution, it is assumed that all emissions are from a standard refrigerant that\xa0has a potential of 2326', 'Modest amounts of electricity are consumed when refrigerant destruction facilities are operated. This is quantified for the solution as energy, in kilowatt-hours per kilogram', 'Financial Model\nFor financial consideration, Project Drawdown decided to consider only the operating cost factor for this solution. No direct up-front costs are applicable for control of leakages from appliances (Purohit and Isaksson, 2016). However, there are operational and maintenance costs per unit of refrigerant for adopting these measures. Only costs of collection, recovery, and destruction were used as operational costs per ton of refrigerant. The annual costs multiplied by the estimated emissions avoided give the total costs and the average annual costs per unit of HFC avoided for different years', 'The total costs for end of life recovery, removal, and destruction are calculated in a similar way', 'Results\nThe total carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions that can be achieved from 2020 to 2050 in Scenario 1 are 57.8 gigatons, with a net operating cost of US$610.7 billion. Scenario 2 optimizes recovery factors and destruction rates, showing an identical reduction of 57.8 gigatons from 2020 to 2050', 'Discussion\nRefrigerant management is difficult to implement because\xa0the appliances are distributed. Weak regulations control leakage of refrigerants, end-of-life recovery, and refrigerant. Further, there are no economic incentives for the recovery of refrigerants. Funding, training, technical, and informational barriers are also some of the limitations for adoption of the solution', 'In order to increase adoption, policies and regulations on recycling/management of refrigerants need to be formulated and implemented. Strong regulations such as a complete ban on venting of refrigerants and accountability of refrigerants must be introduced in national legislation. Economic incentives for recovery, recycling, and destruction of refrigerants, such as the issue of carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol, would help increase the adoption in developing countries. Capacity-building in these countries, including technology transfer, would help aid faster adoption of the solution', '\n\n\n[1]\xa0e.g.,\xa0chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-502; hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) like R-22; hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R404A, R134a, and R 407; and natural refrigerants like CO2 and NH3', '\n\n[2]\xa0the total quantity of refrigerant gases in existing equipment\n\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in the base year of study.

65,Regenerative Annual Cropping,"['Project Drawdown defines regenerative annual cropping as\xa0any annual cropping system that includes at least four of the following six practices: compost application, cover crops, crop rotation, green manures, no-till or reduced tillage, and/or organic production. These practices sequester carbon in soils and reduce emissions at modest rates, but have wide adoption potential and thus impressive mitigation potential. This practice replaces conventional annual cropping as well as conservation agriculture', 'These diverse systems incorporate the best of both conservation agriculture and organic/agroecological annual cropping. Conservation agriculture becomes more ecological by adding additional elements like compost application, while organic is striving to move away from its strong emphasis on tillage. Both may be converging on a new approach, which is modeled here', 'Note: Many other Project Drawdown practices are also defined as “regenerative” by many authors, but this solution focuses on annual cropping only, excluding rice production. \nMethodology\nTotal Land Area[1]\nTotal land available for regenerative annual cropping is 685 million hectares, consisting of annual nondegraded cropland of minimal slopes.[2] Current adoption[3] is estimated at 11.84 million hectares, based on the total area of organic agriculture by Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FIBL) statistics (Willer et al. 2018)– though not all regenerative agriculture is organic, and not all organic agriculture is regenerative', 'Adoption Scenarios[4]\nThe adoption rate of regenerative annual cropping is modeled on the rapid growth of organic agriculture (Willer, 2016). Conservation agriculture is considered a bridge to regenerative annual cropping, and their adoption scenarios are linked. Thus, it was assumed that the adoption of conservation agriculture will increase initially from its current growth rate and level of adoption, and later on those adopted areas will be shifted to regenerative annual cropping, a more advanced and desirable form of conservation agriculture. However, it was also assumed that the area under conservation agriculture will never be zero, and it will remain at the minimum of the level of the current adoption as of the base year (2014)', 'Nine custom adoption scenarios were developed for regenerative annual cropping. All begin with current adoption of 11.84 million hectares. Adoption is based on regional organic agriculture growth rates, with additional growth to reflect conversion of land area from conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping. However, in two of the nine custom adoption scenarios, adoption of regenerative annual cropping was modeled independent of the conservation agriculture land area conversion. The conservative adoption scenarios assume that adoption continues through 2050, while the aggressive adoption scenarios assume an early high growth, resulting in peak adoption (80% of the total adoption) by 2030. The total land area allocated to regenerative annual cropping and conservation agriculture is the same—685 million hectares—which is allocated differently under different custom adoption scenarios', 'Impacts of increased adoption of regenerative annual cropping from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: Analysis of the seven custom adoption scenarios results in the adoption of 221.3 million hectares under regenerative annual cropping by 2050', 'Scenario 2: This scenario results in the adoption of 321.9 million hectares under regenerative agriculture by 2050', '\nIn the absence of sufficient data about regenerative annual cropping, this study uses the Drawdown model developed for conservation agriculture, which uses three of the six regenerative agriculture practices (cover cropping, crop rotation, and no-till)', 'Emissions, Sequestration, and Yield Model\nSequestration rates are set using the upper boundary from the conservation agriculture model because\xa0regenerative annual cropping adds known sequestration practices to the three already practiced in conservation agriculture.

Not all organic agriculture is regenerative, nor is all regenerative agriculture organic. Most land that is certified organic is grassland\xa0rather than annual cropland. However, it serves as a stand-in, given the lack of better data. The area is likely at least this large: For example, Pretty et al. (2006) estimate 37 million hectares of agroecological production in the tropics alone. It is also a fairly large assumption that conservation agriculture will transition to regenerative annual cropping to such a degree, though all it takes for conservation agriculture to meet the criteria is the addition of any one of the following: green manures, compost application, or organic. The Drawdown conservation agriculture model, on which much of this study was based, was itself constrained by limited access to financial data at the farm, regional, and global levels.

66,Silvopasture,"['Project Drawdown defines silvopasture as\xa0the addition of trees to pastures for increased productivity and biosequestration. This solution replaces conventional livestock grazing on pasture and rangeland', 'Research suggests that silvopasture systems can store significant amounts of carbon in both soils and tree biomass, while maintaining or increasing productivity and providing a suite of additional benefits. Traditional silvopasture systems, such as the dehesa in Spain and forest pastures in Scotland, have existed for centuries. More recently, research efforts have demonstrated the high suitability of this system for Latin American grasslands, and several organizations and governments have been working to promote its adoption', 'Under silvopasture, emissions of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide continue, but are more than offset by carbon sequestration, at least until soil carbon saturation is achieved. Drawdown takes the conservative assumption that emissions do not change with conversion from conventional to managed grazing', 'Climate mitigation literature often lumps silvopasture into an undifferentiated “agroforestry”\xa0category with multistrata agroforestry and tree intercropping. Silvopasture’s high sequestration rates and increased meat and dairy yields make it worthy of consideration on its own. Though managed grazing has been the focus on much attention for its climate mitigation potential, this study demonstrates that silvopasture is also worthy of attention. In fact, it is shown to have a substantially higher mitigation impact than managed grazing itself', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nTotal available land is calculated at 823 million hectares, and consists of nondegraded grassland with minimal or moderate slopes in humid climates.[1] Current adoption[2] of silvopasture is estimated at 550 million hectares, based on \xa0Lal (2018) estimates[3]', 'Adoption Scenarios\nIn the absence of limited data available either on historical growth rates of silvopasture or of any future projections, Project Drawdown’s future adoption is based on linear projections of current global data on documenting areas under silvopasture and grazing and pasture.

Projections for GDP per capita[1] were then used to project how the number of Internet-enabled households would change over 2020-2050.

The marginal capital cost of this would be US$155 billion, but it would save US$1.8 trillion in lifetime operating costs due to reduced energy consumption for space heating and cooling. Based on the financial impacts alone, it is clear that global adoption of smart thermostats is economically viable and could provide a significant return on investment.

These costs were normalized for the estimated number of users each system type may have, and a learning rate of 15 percent was applied. This rate was based on the assumption that most of the installation costs would come from upgrading network connectivity to be able to provide the quality needed. The cost of a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet LAN card was used as a proxy for this and, using price data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, we estimated the learning rate', 'The conventional alternative of air travel has no first costs, but the operating costs were taken as the cost per passenger-kilometer of business travel.[4] We estimated the average short-haul and long-haul trip distance based on data on the most popular business travel routes.[5] These trip lengths were used to normalize the trip costs per passenger-kilometer. The operating cost for telepresence systems was estimated from broadband internet costs and maintenance', 'Integration\nLimited adjustments are required for integration, since this solution is relatively independent from the others, and seen as a higher priority than the Efficient Aviation solution. Total demand (i.e., passenger-kilometers avoided) did not exceed total non-urban travel predicted. The additional demand on the electricity grid resulting from the growth of telepresence was accounted for in the integrated total market for electricity. To avoid double-counting emissions benefits, the results presented for telepresence do not reflect the increasingly cleaner grid; instead, the additional emissions benefits are accounted for directly in the supply-side energy solutions', 'Results\nScenario 1 results in a 1 gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions with US$1.2 trillion[6] in operating savings for only US$104\xa0billion in setup costs. In addition, our analysis indicates that replacing travel with telepresence can potentially save up to 107 billion hours of valuable employee time (lower productivity when traveling) that would otherwise be lost during this period. Scenario 2 shows an avoidance of 3.8 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions (and 143 billion fewer unproductive hours)', 'Discussion\nImplicit in our aggressive growth projections is the assumption that telepresence quality can be high enough to allow the kind of business interaction that face-to-face meetings allow. For very important meetings, subtle cues and communication are key; currently, much of this nonverbal communication is lost in videoconferencing. Virtual reality and augmented reality are technologies that can potentially improve the quality of electronic communication; with the rapid advances observed in the market, we believe that the kinds of adoption shown in this work are possible. However, they will require commitment from top management, resource support, and clear company policies on travel reduction. Considering that the financial results shown can be attractive to companies, even more so if the reduction in unproductive travel hours is included, investing in enterprise-wide videoconferencing solutions is one of the most cost-effective ways for companies to both cut carbon emissions and improve employee productivity', 'Note: August 2021 corrections appear in\xa0boldface', '\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

This solution replaces conventional annual crop production on degraded cropland', 'The main purpose of growing trees varies across different types of tree intercropping. Some systems use trees to support annual crop production (e.g., intercropping with nitrogen-fixing trees, as in evergreen agriculture) or as protective systems against erosion, flooding, or wind damage (e.g., hedgerows, riparian buffers, and windbreaks). In other systems, the trees are crops themselves (e.g., strip intercropping of annual crops with timber or fruit trees)', 'Tree intercropping is an important strategy for producing annual crops while sequestering carbon in soils and above-ground biomass. It provides important co-benefits, including erosion control, riparian stabilization, soil fertility improvements, and, in many cases, increased yields. Tree intercropping systems are widely adopted by tropical smallholders, but are also practiced on millions of hectares of cropland in highly mechanized regions of China and Europe', 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nThe total available land for tree intercropping is 494 million hectares of degraded and nondegraded cropland.[1] Current adoption[2] is allocated on the nondegraded cropland. To date, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the current adoption levels of different forms of tree intercropping do exist. Lal et al. (2018) estimated\xa0the total global extent of tree intercropping systems at approximately 600 million hectares. A more comprehensive study\xa0(Zomer et al., 2014) used\xa0global remote sensing data to estimate total global cropland with >10 percent, >20 percent, and >30 percent tree cover. Given the resolution of satellite data used for the study, these\xa0data do\xa0not necessarily differentiate between tree intercropping systems and small areas with trees adjacent to cropland and should therefore be taken as a rough estimate. Moreover, to avoid double counting, our estimates only consider areas dedicated to tree intercropping, excluding annual cropping areas with sparse trees. These areas are part of our conservation agriculture, regenerative annual cropping, improved rice production, and system of rice Intensification solutions.

Tree plantation on degraded land also aims to reduce emissions from deforestation by providing an alternative source of timber, though this impact is not modeled here', ""Tree plantation on degraded land has been widely promoted as a land-based mitigation strategy due in part to its high sequestration rates. Project Drawdown's tree plantation on degraded land scenarios are more modest than many. This is because other tree-focused solutions with high sequestration rates are given higher priority, including tree intercropping, silvopasture, multistrata agroforestry, perennial staple\xa0crops, tropical forest\xa0restoration, and temperate forest\xa0restoration. Nonetheless, tree plantation on degraded land is of critical importance for mitigation, building material, and restoration of degraded lands"", 'Methodology\nTotal Land Area\nThe total area allocated for tree plantation on degraded land is 718 million hectares, and is composed of degraded grassland and forest.

74,Utility-Scale Energy Storage,"['Project Drawdown defines utility-scale energy storage\xa0as\xa0new technologies and practices to store energy on a utility level. This solution does not replace a conventional practice, but is key to the development of variable renewable energy sources.\xa0\nEnergy storage allows for power to be generated at a time different from when it is consumed (a process known as “time shift”). In a power system with significant amounts of large-scale energy storage, every type of generation can be used in the most optimal fashion. Large centralized generators can run at a steady rate, with no need to undergo inefficient cycling to respond to changes in demand. If the power generated by solar or wind installations exceeds demand, it can be stored for later use rather than rejected by the grid (or “curtailed”). The most rapidly responding forms of energy storage can account for fluctuations in demand in a second or less, far outpacing even the natural gas–fired plants currently used to respond to demand peaks. In addition, energy storage can provide a number of other valuable services. Storage can relieve congestion on transmission lines, increasing reliability and performance and allowing for the efficient use of existing infrastructure. Moreover, storage makes the power system more resilient, reducing outages and aiding in emergency preparedness', 'While it is not possible to store energy in the form of electricity, it is possible to convert electrical energy to another form that can be stored. There are many possible forms in which the energy can be stored, including: (1) gravitational potential energy (pumped hydroelectric energy storage); (2) chemical energy (batteries); (3) mechanical energy (flywheels or compressed air energy storage); (4) thermal energy storage (molten salt); and\xa0(5) hydrogen storage', 'According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s global energy storage databases (2019), there are currently 1687 large-scale energy storage operational systems worldwide, with 191 gigawatts. The vast majority (95 percent) of this capacity is composed of pumped hydroelectric technology, followed by thermal storage (1.7 percent) and electromechanical (1.4 percent). In 2017, lithium-ion batteries accounted for nearly 90% of large-scale battery storage additions (IEA, 2018)', 'Of all the storage options, only pumped hydroelectric is classified as a mature technology, with more than 350 large projects installed worldwide. The majority of this technology is installed in China, Japan, and the United States. Other countries, such as Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and India, have less installed capacity. Hydrogen storage technology is still in the demonstration phases, with less than 15 megawatts installed mainly in Germany, since it has low round-trip conversion efficiency compared with\xa0other technologies. Utility-scale batteries (lithium ion, advanced lead acid, sodium nickel chloride, and sodium ion) are mainly installed in the United Sttes and Japan, while the compressed air and flywheel technologies are mainly found in Germany and the United States. The molten salt thermal storage, which is associated with concentrated solar power (CSP), is mainly installed in the United States and Spain', 'The primary use of energy storage at present is power arbitrage (time shift): pumped hydropower facilities buy electricity at night when prices are low\xa0and use it to pump water from a low reservoir to an elevated one. During the day, when prices are high, the stored water is allowed to run downhill through turbines, generating electricity that can then be sold back to the grid. This has been the primary mechanism through which energy storage projects earn revenue. Currently, more than 94 percent of this technology’s capacity is used for the time shift application. The remaining energy storage technologies are used to enable penetration of variable renewable generation sources: 25 percent of the compressed air installation capacity is used for wind energy application, 28 percent of the batteries’ capacity is used for solar, and 100 percent of molten salt storage is used for concentrated solar power', 'Methodology\nThis solution is key for integrating variable renewable generation sources into the electricity grid,\xa0balancing the supply and demand for electricity,\xa0replacing natural gas peaking plants,\xa0allowing increased reliance on base load generation,\xa0and avoiding the need to cycle baseload units. Without storage, variable renewable energy technologies face high curtailment rates; thus, storage is a crucial aspect of enabling a low-carbon grid', 'To avoid double counting, the climate impact of the bulk of the technologies under the utility scale energy storage solution is accounted for in the adoption of distributed electricity generation technologies such as wind and solar. Molten salt storage is accounted for in the impact of increased adoption of concentrated solar power', 'Discussion\nCurrent and future investments in utility-scale energy storage units are important when considered in the context of the infrastructure, including transmission and distribution upgrades, expansion of natural gas-fired peaking capacity that storage can replace, and the revenue streams available to storage operators both now and under prospective policy frameworks', 'Utility-scale energy storage transforms the way we produce, deliver, and consume electricity toward a cleaner and more efficient energy mix. While energy storage increases energy demand due to its inefficiency, the increased efficiency of the grid offsets this, meaning that all carbon savings from the use of clean, renewable variable generation sources can be fully realized', 'In addition, energy storage increases the flexibility and resilience of the grid. The numerous benefits of energy storage indicate that is a key component of the future of the energy system, particularly under significantly increased electrification. At present, regulatory agencies are in the process of determining pricing models for the many other benefits of storage. Upon the adoption of such price signals, it can be expected that the financial incentive for the development of large-scale storage will increase significantly, leading to a sharp upswing in storage capacity. Indeed, a number of other energy storage technologies—such as compressed air, batteries, and flywheels—are rapidly undergoing technological development and proving, and their costs are decreasing', 'Appropriate remuneration for the many benefits of storage would allow these technologies to reach a profitable price much faster, again increasing the rate at which storage is added to the grid. A number of governments have recognized the importance of energy storage in a modern power grid that incorporates decarbonized generation and smart grid technologies. Japan, the states of California and Texas, and several European countries have agreed to subsidize demonstration-scale plants or have requisitioned a certain level of storage capacity to be installed in the near future.']"

This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Since 2010, the photovoltaic market has grown tremendously. At least 480 gigawatts of total solar PV capacity were installed worldwide by the end of 2018\xa0(IRENA, 2019), with each new year adding records of grid-connected capacity. In many regional markets, newly installed capacity came primarily from utility-scale installations rather than distributed solar PV panels. In many markets, the newly installed capacity is coming primarily from utility-scale installations rather than from distributed systems. As a result, ambitious projections are now being made on higher adoption of renewable energy for power generation. Some recent scenarios have even predicted almost 60 percent\xa0of global electricity generation to come from solar energy by 2050', 'Methodology\nTo capture the appropriate level of agency, the solar PV market was split between distributed solar photovoltaics (representing households and building owners) and utility-scale solar photovoltaics', ""Total Addressable Market\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector's solutions, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration.

Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nComparing the results from the two modeled scenarios to the Reference Scenario allows us to estimate the climate and financial impacts of increased adoption of utility-scale PV systems. Scenario 1 projects 20.3 percent (i.e., over 9300 terawatt-hours) of total electricity generation worldwide coming from utility-scale solar by 2050. In Scenario 2, the market share reaches 25 percent associated with 17742 terawatt-hours of electricity generated under a higher total addressable market', 'The Scenario 1 results in the avoidance of 42.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2050, with US$3317 \xa0billion in savings from associated net first costs. Nearly US$12 trillion of lifetime operating savings are projected, principally because utility-scale PV does not require any fuel inputs. Scenario 2 is more ambitious in the growth of utility-scale PV technologies, with impacts on greenhouse gas emissions reductions over 2020–2050 of 119.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent', 'Discussion\nSolar photovoltaic has seen unprecedented levels of growth around the world since 2005, due primarily to advancements in technology and declines in costs. Only modest advancements in production are needed before utility-scale systems are cost-competitive with fossil fuel generation around the world. As a result, utility-scale PV is likely to continue its rapid growth in many regional markets and will play an increasingly important role in future global electricity supply, regardless of climate mitigation goals. If utilities and project developers, spurred on by local and national governments, accelerate the adoption of utility-scale solar over the next 30 years, the world will reap major benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, as demonstrated by our results. The rapid deployment of utility-scale PV will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (and corresponding atmospheric concentrations) by displacing emissions associated with coal and natural gas. Solar has an incredibly promising long-term potential, as solar resources are plentiful and widespread, and future advances in both battery and photovoltaic technologies should continue to drive the adoption of this technology, even without specific policy interventions. The financial benefits of rapid utility-scale PV adoption will also be considerable, and these can help jump-start adoption. There are significant investment costs associated with accelerated adoption, but this is an opportunity to generate wealth and economic growth, because\xa0the return on investment is also substantial', 'The accelerated installation of new utility-scale PV capacity will not be without challenges, however, as traditional electricity markets and grids are in many cases not primed for a high penetration of intermittent, renewable energy. There will be economic, policy, and social hurdles to overcome on the pathway set out in our scenarios, and some of these will require significant changes to the way we buy, sell, and even use electricity. But given the immense climate and financial impacts of global utility-scale PV adoption, it is imperative that we take on these challenges in order to realize the benefits', '\xa0\n\n\n[1\xa0Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand (i.e., terawatt-hours) supplied by the solution in 2018', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 $US', '\n\n[3] For example: LED lighting and high efficiency heat pumps.']"
76,Walkable Cities,"['Project Drawdown defines walkable cities as\xa0designing and retrofitting urban environments to encourage walking for commuting or transportation. This solution replaces the conventional practice of driving internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in cities', 'Walking is the most neglected mode of transportation: the simplest, most sustainable, and cheapest medium of locomotion. In 2018, humanity walked 1573 billion kilometers, or an average of 200 kilometers (130 miles) per person per year—barely 7\xa0minutes per day. We drive seven\xa0times as much as we walk. Walkability is still associated only with leisure and recreation in the majority of urban projects around the world; however, the notion of walking as a competitor in the area of sustainable urban mobility is increasing', 'Walkability has commonly been measured according to the “7Ds”: 1) Density of activity, 2) Diversity of land uses, 3) Design of the street network, 4) Destination accessibility by distance or time, 5) Distance to transit, 6) Demand management, and 7) Demographics (which is not part of the built environment, but still important). These Ds influence patterns in travel choices based on the characteristics of users. Because there is insufficient measurement of all variables for large numbers of cities, this analysis focuses on population density as the key indicator for walkability.[1]\nMethodology\nThis solution measures the impact of urban dwellers increasingly switching from ICE car use to walking', 'Total Addressable Market\nThe total addressable market for walkable cities is defined as the total urban mobility, expressed in passenger-kilometers. Several sources are used to project growth of the market from 2014 to 2050.[2] Current adoption[3] is estimated at 4.9 percent of the market, based on data published by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and the University of California–Davis (UCD)', 'Higher population density, if assumed correlated to density of points of interest (residences, workplaces, shopping, leisure, etc.), can lead to increased walking as destinations become easier for residents to get to on foot. It is assumed that the density threshold for walkability is 3000–4000 people per square kilometer (7.8–10.4 thousand per square mile),[5] and that high-density cities could lead to residents walking for 6.5–7 percent of urban trips. By contrast, residents in non-dense cities of less than 3,000 people per square kilometer typically walk around 2 percent of all urban passenger-kilometers. With no single definitive metric to measure a walkable city, and due to the high variability of cities globally, projected growth in urban population density is used as a proxy for the increased adoption of walkability in general.[5] It is important to note that city densities have been declining by up to 2 percent annually', 'Adoption Scenarios[6]\nImpacts of increased adoption of walkable cities from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0 Reference Scenario, in which\xa0the total amount of walking follows a baseline projection from the ITDP/UC Davis Study.[7]\n\nScenario 1: Adoption is aligned with high growth projections from the 2015 publication of the ITDP/UCD joint report, “A Global High Shift Cycling Scenario,” with 3.5 percent of urban mobility by walking in 2050 (as opposed to 2.7 percent\xa0in the Reference Scenario)', 'Scenario 2: Using the default density threshold and walking mode-share values discussed above, the amount of walking that would happen in 1737 cities worldwide is projected using data from Demographia, representing 57 percent of the global urban population. This estimate is then scaled to 100 percent of the world’s urban population', '\nEmissions Model\nEmission reductions are calculated by replacing fuel consumption and indirect emissions associated with the production of cars with walking, which has zero direct emissions. Indirect food emissions (e.g., from food distribution increases caused by eating more) are excluded', 'Financial Model\nCosts for ICE cars include fixed operating costs (e.g., insurance), fuel costs, and other variable operating costs such as\xa0maintenance and depreciation.[8] While increased walking may result in the need to purchase higher quantities of food because of burning more calories, implementation and operating costs are considered to be zero', 'Results\nThe Scenario 1 estimates that 2589 billion passenger-kilometers of urban travel will be done on foot by 2050, or about twice the current distance per urban resident per year. This results in 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions avoided, saving travelers US$1.7 trillion[9] in operating costs of driving a car. The Scenario 2 shows a reduction of 5.5 gigatons of emissions by 2050', 'Discussion\nThis most basic mode of travel has been neglected for a long time; however, our study shows that it can be a part of a set of global drawdown strategies. It is acknowledged that there are challenges to increasing walking. We ignored implementation costs, as those are likely highly variable and city-dependent. Making cities denser and taking other steps to improve walking, however, takes a lot of time and requires skills that may not be available in many cities. Walking more often requires partly a cultural change in many places; as walking may be seen as the “poor man’s option,” changing attitudes must go hand in hand with changing cityscapes', 'At the same time, making walking easier in cities can make other sustainable modes of transport more attractive: cycling, e-biking, and mass transit all stand to gain from improved walkability in cities. Ideally, all of these more efficient modes can be promoted together. There are likely some benefits of combined promotion that we have not included in any of our analyses due to lack of data. In any case, walking ease is a critical part of adoption of the other modes, and cannot be ignored', '\n\n\n[1] Population density is only one of seven variables, but it has the most available global data. These seven variables are highly interrelated and are challenging to model independently', '\n\n[2] Sources include: the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and the University of California –Davis (UCD)', '\n\n[3] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand supplied by the solution in 2018.

77,Waste-to-Energy,"['Project Drawdown defines waste-to-energy as the combustion of waste and conversion to electricity and usable heat in waste-to-energy plants. This solution replaces conventional electricity-generating technologies such as coal, oil, and natural gas power plants', 'Waste-to-energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions in many cases, though the magnitude of that reduction varies substantially depending on the baseline used for comparison. Key considerations in waste-to-energy’s case include: the caloric content of combusted waste; its methane generation potential (were it to be landfilled); likely alternative waste disposal pathways; and the emissions intensity of electricity and/or heat being displaced by that generated by the waste-to-energy process', 'Waste-to-energy has seen wide adoption in Europe, the United States, and Japan, and adoption is growing rapidly in China. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are most likely to see significant growth in its market penetration moving forward, because\xa0the primary barriers to entry for waste-to-energy are high capital cost (in part due to high-cost pollution control technologies, which are essential in mitigating potential adverse public health impacts) and the reliable availability of municipal solid waste with a high caloric heating value. Waste-to-energy adoption will have the largest climate impact when it displaces both landfill disposal (particularly with low methane capture) and carbon-intensive power generation (i.e., coal, natural gas, and oil combustion)', 'Methodology\nWaste-to-energy adoption is presented in two ways: in terawatt-hours of electricity generation, and in tons of waste produced. Both types of presentations are used in the adoption prognostications', 'Total Addressable Market\nTwo total addressable markets were developed for this sector solution, supported on lower and higher climate emissions mitigation targets linked to different levels of electricity demand and renewable energy sources integration. The total addressable market for waste-to-energy is based on projected global electricity generation from 2020 to 2050. Current adoption[1] was estimated at 0.54 percent of generation (i.e.,142 terawatt-hours)', 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of waste-to-energy from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two\xa0growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison to a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which\xa0the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: This scenario is built upon the average yearly adoption of six custom scenarios derived from conservative adoption scenarios from the IEA (2016) ETP 4DS and 6DS, Greenpeace (2015) \xa0Energy [R]evolution and Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenarios, and different scenarios supported on the methodology suggested by Monni et al. (2006), applying different caps to waste to energy use. This results in a 1.1. percent share of the total electricity generation portfolio in 2050, with 493 terawatt-hours of electricity generated', 'Scenario 2: This scenario is built upon the average yearly adoption of two custom scenarios derived from ambitious solution adoption trajectories, i.e., IEA (2016) ETP 2DS and IEA (2016) \xa0ETP Annex 1 methodology. This results in a 0.3 \xa0percent share of the total electricity generation portfolio in 2050, with 210 terawatt-hours of electricity generated', '\nThe resulting adoptions are adjusted on the waste cluster integration model due to waste feedstock limitations. Tons of waste used in waste-to-energy processes are converted to terawatt-hours of electricity produced by multiplying an estimated heating value of waste and average efficiency of waste-to-energy plants', 'The uncertainty associated with the future adoption of waste-to-energy is linked to other waste management solutions: landfill methane capture, large methane digesters, recycling, and composting could affect the balance of available waste for each solution. Thus, the Scenario 2s have lower adoption trajectories of waste-to-energy than the Scenario 1', 'Emissions Model\nThe result of the assessment is a regionally explicit forecast of waste-to-energy adoption and climate impacts, in terms of both avoided methane and carbon dioxide emissions. Landfill methane emission rates are estimated using the first-order decay method recommended by the IPCC in order to estimate total emissions reduction for waste-to-energy in comparison with sending the waste to a landfill', 'Financial Model\nThe financial inputs used in the model assume an average installation cost of US$6795 per kilowatt.[2] Since waste-to-energy using incineration is a mature technology that has been in widespread use in OECD countries for many decades, a learning rate of 2 percent is applied to first costs. An average capacity factor of 77 percent is used for waste-to-energy plants from historical data, compared to 57 percent for conventional technologies. Fixed operation and maintenance costs of US$304.9 per kilowatt are considered for waste to energy systems, compared to US$34.7 per kilowatt for the conventional technologies. variable operation and maintenance costs of\nIntegration\nThrough the process of integrating waste to energy with other solutions, the total addressable markets were adjusted to account for reduced demand resulting from the growth of more energy-efficient technologies,[3] as well as increased electrification from other solutions like electric cars and high-speed rail. Grid emissions factors were calculated based on the annual mix of different electricity generating technologies over time. Emissions factors for each technology were determined through a meta-analysis of multiple sources, accounting for direct and indirect emissions', 'Results\nThe results for Scenario 1 show that through increased global adoption of waste-to-energy from 2020 to 2050, 73 gigawatts of waste-to-energy plants can be installed globally, increasing the electricity generation market share for this technology from 0.54 percent to 1.1 percent. This will result in the avoided emissions of 2.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent of greenhouse gases. The net cost compared with\xa0the Reference Scenario would be US$134.7 billion from 2020 to 2050, and around US$96.7 billion of negative lifetime savings for waste-to-energy plants', 'Due to integration with other waste management solutions covered in Project Drawdown, the solution adoption is lower in the Scenario 2 since more preferred solutions are increasingly adopted. Nevertheless due to the double counting methodology and the higher total addressable market in Scenario 2, it results on higher emission reductions over 2020–2050 of 3.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent', 'Discussion\nWhile preferable to landfilling, waste-to-energy is seen as a bridge technology before other preferable waste management options become fully possible', 'Promotion of waste-to-energy will be most successful where waste disposal and electricity costs are high, and where capital is readily available. Waste-to-energy should be promoted appropriately in each region’s context, within a broader framework of integrated solid waste management. This is all the more important given the potentially significant public health risk that insufficiently regulated waste-to-energy can pose (and has historically posed) to nearby communities. When appropriately strict pollution controls are in place, and when landfilling is a likely waste disposal alternative, waste-to-energy will nonetheless continue to provide an opportunity for societally beneficial greenhouse gas emissions reduction', 'New waste-to-energy research in Europe and the United States is relatively sparse now, as a result of the technology’s maturity. More active research is ongoing, particularly in East Asia. In general, research resources are more heavily allocated to new technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis, and plasma-arc gasification (as opposed to combustion). While these technologies are common in Japan, they have yet to become mainstream in any other part of the world', '\xa0\n\n\n[1] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand (terawatt-hours) supplied by the solution in 2018', '\n\n[2] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$', '\n\n[3] For example: LED lighting and high efficiency heat pumps.']"
78,Water Distribution Efficiency,"['Project Drawdown defines water distribution as\xa0reducing water leakage or oversupply of regional water, which reduces pumping and pressurization electricity and associated greenhouse gas emissions. This solution replaces conventional water system management with no specific leak detection program', 'Water utilities are among the biggest consumers of electricity globally, corresponding to about 1 percent\xa0of total electricity use in the world. Up to 80 percent of that energy is used for pumping alone. However, a significant amount of water is lost in the distribution network (e.g., by pipe leakage, meter error, and unauthorized consumption): the global average loss is estimated at 35 percent. This has a direct impact on the production cost of water, as well as on the available quantity of potable water. Saving just half of these losses would supply water to an additional 100 million people (The World Bank, 2006)', 'There are a number of ways to minimize leakage. Pressure management and active leak detection are two major ones. Pressure management involves installing pressure valves at water inlets and outlets to better monitor the flow of water and pressures, and leads to reductions in pipe bursts and leaks from broken pipes. Active leak detection can be performed using a range of technologies, such as thermal imaging, noise logging, or gas injection. Prices and precision vary for these approaches, but the value can be high, especially for high operating cost, high water scarcity regions', 'This analysis examines the financial and emissions impacts of a high adoption of pressure management and active leak control globally, and compares that to conventional system management with no specific leak detection program', ""Methodology\nTotal Addressable Market\nProject Drawdown’s method starts by estimating how much water is actually used globally by municipalities. This was done in two ways. An exponential curve of water use per year was developed from 20 previous estimates of global water distribution for specific years dating from 1900 to 2025 (Hejazi et al, 2013). This estimate was combined with empirical data reported by hundreds of water utilities in the International Benchmark Network Database (IB-NET, n.d.) to arrive at estimates for per-capita water production for all regions in the world. Combined with water supply statistics from\xa0the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF, 2015) to arrive at Urban and Rural shares, the total addressable market for each region was obtained. Relying on both recently reported data and theoretical estimates over several years and studies strengthened the final estimate used: 438 billion cubic meters of water treated and supplied in 2014"", 'Adoption Scenarios\nImpacts of increased adoption of water distribution from 2020 to 2050 were generated based on two growth scenarios. These\xa0were assessed in comparison with\xa0a\xa0Reference\xa0Scenario, in which the solution’s market share was fixed at the current levels', '\nScenario 1: The adoption of pressure management and active leak control is assumed to rise linearly to 38 percent of the global water distribution network', 'Scenario 2: This linear growth reaches 47 percent of the global water distribution network', '\nEmissions Model\nEmissions estimates were calculated for electricity consumption for water treatment and distribution (with a weighted share for each of desalination, surface water, and ground water). The result was 1.27 gigawatt-hours of electricity per million cubic meters of water supplied. Leakage activities were estimated (over 18 data points) to reduce this by 29 percent, and emissions factors for this grid electricity came from the guides of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)', 'Financial Model\nFirst costs for pressure management and active leak control were averaged based on how much water they save on average, so are reported here in million cubic meters of water saved. From nine\xa0data points covering Europe, North America, and Asia, the installation cost is US$33402 per million cubic meters of water saved.[1] Net implementation costs is US$17.4 billion. No costs were applied to the conventional approach, since the solution was assumed to be in addition to conventional techniques. Operating costs for conventional systems were obtained from five\xa0data points coming mainly from the IB-NET Database and averaging US$444000 per million cubic meters of water supplied. Data from Kanakoudis & Gonelas (2016) indicate\xa0the operating savings coming from leakage reduction activities; this results in a net operating savings of US$168 billion per million cubic meters of water supplied', 'Results\nBased on the results from Project Drawdown’s Scenario 1, reducing nonrevenue water would yield a 0.66-gigaton reduction in global carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from 2020 to 2050. This is expected to drawdown greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 0.06 parts per million by 2050 and bring operations savings of US$168 billion. In Scenario 2, the emissions impact is 0.94 gigatons', 'Discussion\nSince water, energy, and climate change are intricately related, the sustainable water management practice of pressure management and active leakage control would contribute to a strategy of reversing emissions. Though pressure management in water distribution networks is an important and cost-effective initial step in curbing water losses, it is important to note that pressure management is not the complete solution to reducing real water losses, because\xa0it does not repair leaks but reduces leak rates and pipe bursts. Utilities, therefore, would need to determine where to deploy pressure management and active leak control, as well as which combinations of these and other solutions are required for managing water losses in their specific situations. Our analysis does not, however, include other leak detection approaches or other water supply systems, such as water conveyance by tanker truck', 'Besides the climate change abatement imperative, water scarcity is an equally important concern for which sustainable water management practices are needed at a global scale. Unpolluted water is already scarce in many regions of the world, and regions with large amounts of water are not guaranteed infinite water resources. Reducing water losses has other manifold benefits. Though not quantitatively estimated in this study, it boosts the revenues of utilities, allows for postponement of investments, and improves customer satisfaction. The complexity of climatic changes to rainfall patterns and the impact on water distribution is not very well known; for this reason, it has been omitted from this analysis', '\n\n\n[1] All monetary values are presented in 2014 US$.']"
